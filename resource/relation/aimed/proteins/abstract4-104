<AbstractText>Liver cirrhosis in patients with short bowel syndrome is successfully treated in humans by simultaneous liver/small bowel transplantation. However, until now, a clinically relevant experimental rat model for this procedure has not existed. We therefore established a protocol that, for the first time in rats, allows the simultaneous transplantation of arterialized liver and small bowel into an orthotopic position. Short-term immunosuppression induced not only allograft acceptance but tolerance (as demonstrated by indicator heart/skin transplantation). The immunosuppressive dose required to achieve this result was dramatically less than that of protocols for successful small bowel transplantation alone. Immunohistochemistry detected a transient rejection crisis before tolerance. During this crisis, apoptotic recipient-type T lymphocytes, mainly <prot>CD8</prot>+ cells, accumulated in the liver but not in the small bowel allograft. The initiation of T-cell apoptosis is one possible explanation for the specific immunosuppressive effect of the liver allograft, which also supports the simultaneously transplanted small bowel allograft in our model.</AbstractText>
