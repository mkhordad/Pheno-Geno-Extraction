<AbstractText>Antisense oligonucleotides are an attractive therapeutic option to modulate specific gene expression. However, not all antisense oligonucleotides are effective in inhibiting gene expression, and currently very few methods exist for selecting the few effective ones from all candidate oligonucleotides. The lack of quantitative methods to rapidly assess the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides also contributes to the difficulty of discovering potent and specific antisense oligonucleotides. We have previously reported the development of a prediction algorithm for identifying high affinity antisense oligonucleotides based on mRNA-oligonucleotide hybridization. In this study, we report the antisense activity of these rationally selected oligonucleotides against three model target mRNAs (human <prot>lactate dehydrogenase A</prot> and B and rat <prot>gp130</prot>) in cell culture. The effectiveness of oligonucleotides was evaluated by a kinetic PCR technique, which allows quantitative evaluation of mRNA levels and thus provides a measure of antisense-mediated decreases in target mRNA, as occurs through <prot>RNase H</prot> recruitment. Antisense oligonucleotides that were predicted to have high affinity for their target proved effective in almost all cases, including tests against three different targets in two cell types with phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotide chemistries. This approach may aid the development of antisense oligonucleotides for a variety of applications.</AbstractText>
