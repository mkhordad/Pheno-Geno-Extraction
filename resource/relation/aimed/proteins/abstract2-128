<AbstractText>Arachidonic acid is metabolized to prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) by <prot>cyclooxygenase</prot> (<prot>COX</prot>). <prot>COX-2</prot>, the inducible <prot>COX isozyme</prot>, has a key role in intestinal polyposis. Among the metabolites of PGH(2), PGE(2) is implicated in tumorigenesis because its level is markedly elevated in tissues of intestinal adenoma and colon cancer. Here we show that homozygous deletion of the gene encoding a cell-surface receptor of PGE(2), <prot>EP2</prot>, causes decreases in number and size of intestinal polyps in Apc(Delta 716) mice (a mouse model for human familial adenomatous polyposis). This effect is similar to that of <prot>COX-2</prot> gene disruption. We also show that <prot>COX-2</prot> expression is boosted by PGE(2) through the <prot>EP2 receptor</prot> via a positive feedback loop. Homozygous gene knockout for other PGE(2) receptors, <prot>EP1</prot> or <prot>EP3</prot>, did not affect intestinal polyp formation in Apc(Delta 716) mice. We conclude that <prot>EP2</prot> is the major receptor mediating the PGE2 signal generated by <prot>COX-2</prot> upregulation in intestinal polyposis, and that increased cellular cAMP stimulates expression of more <prot>COX-2</prot> and vascular endothelial growth factor in the polyp stroma.</AbstractText>
