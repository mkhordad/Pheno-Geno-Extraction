<AbstractText>A clinical goal for ex vivo expansion of cord blood (CB) <prot>CD34</prot>(+) cells is to shorten the period of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia following myeloablative therapy and transplantation. Prolongation of cytokine expansion leads to the production of greater numbers of cells, and should have an impact on neutrophil and platelet recovery. Furthermore, expansion of <prot>CD34</prot>(+) cells should support the continued production of neutrophils and platelets in the 6-week period following transplantation. We tested these hypotheses by characterization of the kinetics (human <prot>CD45</prot>(+) cells in the blood) and phenotype (<prot>CD45</prot>, <prot>CD34</prot>, <prot>CD61</prot>, <prot>CD33</prot>, <prot>CD19</prot> and <prot>CD3</prot>) of human engraftment in the non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mouse (NOD-SCID) following 7 or 14 d of ex vivo expansion of CB <prot>CD34</prot>(+) cells. Mice transplanted with 14 d cells showed greater percentages of human <prot>CD45</prot>(+) cells in the blood, bone marrow and spleen than mice transplanted with unexpanded cells or 7 d cells. Prolonging cytokine exposure of <prot>CD34</prot>(+) cells and transplantation with increasing numbers of input cells facilitated the production of absolute numbers of <prot>CD34</prot>(+), <prot>CD33</prot>(+), <prot>CD61</prot>(+) and <prot>CD19</prot>(+) cells in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of SCID engrafting potential showed that prolongation of culture duration facilitates in vivo expansion of <prot>CD45</prot>(+), <prot>CD34</prot>(+) and <prot>CD19</prot>(+) cells after transplantation. It is anticipated that prolonged (2 weeks) ex vivo culture of CB will have a beneficial clinical effect.</AbstractText>
