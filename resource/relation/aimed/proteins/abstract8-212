<AbstractText>We have established four cell lines from a human malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Each cell line had human aneuploid karyotype and DNA aneuploidy. Cells in all lines expressed <prot>CD13</prot>, <prot>CD68</prot> and <prot>vimentin</prot> but lacked <prot>CD11</prot>, <prot>CD14</prot>, <prot>CD15</prot>, <prot>CD16</prot>, <prot>CD45</prot>, HLA class II and other mesenchymal and epithelial markers such as <prot>desmin</prot>, alpha-smooth muscle, <prot>myoglobin</prot>, <prot>S-100 protein</prot>, and <prot>cytokeratin</prot>. None of the cells expressed surface IgG or C3 receptor, nor did any of them phagocytose latex particles. The cells reacted with an antibody for prolyl-4-hydroxylase, but no collagen (types I, II, III, or IV) was detected in any of the cell lines. The homogenates of all cell lines had cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3 activity. Two cell lines produced <prot>granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</prot> (<prot>G-CSF</prot>), <prot>interleukin (IL)-1alpha</prot>, <prot>IL-6</prot> and <prot>tumor necrosis factor alpha</prot>, another line produced <prot>G-CSF</prot>, <prot>IL-1alpha</prot>, <prot>IL-6</prot> and <prot>platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB</prot>, and the remaining cell line produced only <prot>PDGF-AB</prot>. None of the cells produced <prot>transforming growth factor-alpha</prot>. The results indicated that the cell lines were immunophenotypically similar to primitive mesenchymal cells.</AbstractText>
