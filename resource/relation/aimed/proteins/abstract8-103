<AbstractText>The multi-subunit <prot>vacuolar ATPase</prot> pump uses ATP hydrolysis to move protons into membrane bound compartments. The pump is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of cytosolic pH, vesicular transport, endocytosis, secretion, and apoptosis. Here, we describe the cDNA cloning and chromosomal mapping of subunit D of murine <prot>V-ATPase</prot>. The mouse gene, designated <prot>Atp6m</prot>, maps to Chromosome 12, in a region of high homology with human chromosome 14q24. Evolutionary analysis of subunit D orthologs in a variety of other species reveals that this is a highly conserved protein that has been under remarkably strong negative selection during evolution, most likely reflecting its critical role in multiple cellular processes.</AbstractText>
