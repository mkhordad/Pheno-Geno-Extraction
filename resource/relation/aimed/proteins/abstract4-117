<AbstractText>This overview of asymmetry addresses the following topics: chiral molecules; asymmetric signaling molecules, including <prot>N-cadherin</prot>, <prot>Shh</prot>, <prot>Fgf8</prot>, <prot>lefty1</prot>, <prot>lefty2</prot>, <prot>nodal</prot>, <prot>Pitx2</prot>, <prot>activin betaB</prot>, <prot>activin receptor IIA</prot>, and <prot>cSnR</prot>; situs abnormalities; asymmetric cell division; laterality in humans and animals; behavioral asymmetry in humans and animals; asymmetric embryopathies, including Tessier-type "clefts"; hemiasymmetries such as hemihyperplasia, hemihypoplasia, and hemiatrophy; asymmetric vascular syndromes, including Klippel-Trenaunay and Sturge-Weber syndromes; plagiocephaly of the synostotic and deformational types; somatic mosaicism, including a discussion of McCune-Albright syndrome, fibrous dysplasia, GNAS1 mutations, and Proteus syndrome.</AbstractText>
