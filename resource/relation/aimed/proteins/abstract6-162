<AbstractText>The hormonal regulation of the <prot>ob</prot> gene and <prot>leptin</prot> secretion in humans is still unclear. To investigate the interactions among <prot>leptin</prot>, cortisol, and <prot>GH</prot>, we analyzed and time-cross-correlated their spontaneous 24-h secretion in 12 short normal prepubertal children of both sexes (6 females and 6 males). Time-cross-correlation analyses demonstrated that <prot>leptin</prot> and cortisol were correlated in both a negative and positive fashion. The negative correlation, with cortisol leading leptin by 4 and 3 h for boys and girls, respectively, might reflect the stimulatory effect of CRH on the sympathetic system, which inhibits leptin secretion; the positive correlation, with leptin leading cortisol by 6 and 5 h for boys and girls, respectively, might reflect a direct effect of leptin on CRH secretion in the hypophyseal portal system. Time-cross-correlation analyses also showed a strong positive correlation between GH and leptin concentrations, with GH leading leptin by 5 and 2 h for boys and girls, respectively, suggesting a possible direct leptin-releasing effect of GH on adipocytes. We conclude that cross-correlation analyses of 24-h hormone secretions under baseline physiological conditions suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis might have a prevailing inhibitory effect on leptin secretion, whereas leptin might exert a positive effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The relation between GH and leptin could be a direct one and characterized prevalently by a positive effect of GH on leptin secretion. Further investigations using different experimental systems are needed to ascertain the validity of these mathematically educed conclusions.</AbstractText>
