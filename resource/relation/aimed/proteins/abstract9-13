<AbstractText>Primitive human hematopoietic cells can be assayed on the basis of their ability to repopulate immune-deficient NOD/SCID mice and have been termed SCID repopulating cells (SRCs). The in vivo biological fate of individual SRCs can be tracked by following the unique retroviral insertion site in the progency of transduced SRCs. Distinct human SRCs were identified that differ in the proliferative and self-renewal capacity indicating that the primitive cell compartment is functionally heterogeneous.</AbstractText>
