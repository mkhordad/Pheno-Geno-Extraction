<AbstractText>Experimental research faces two great problems: the significant reduction of public funding and the firm opposition of the public opinion. The law forbids the use of large animals, so that it is possible to use small animals only, which require microsurgical techniques. However, even a skillful surgeon does not know how to perform microsurgery and has to begin a long and tiring training to master techniques. We think that experimental surgery should play a role because it tests the validity and safety of new surgical techniques and allows special pathophysiological aspects to be studied. Furthermore experimental surgery could represent an essential stage in the training of young surgeons. We should find a balance between observance of the law and respect of the animals and, on the other hand, the role of experimental surgery because we should not forget that its most important aim is the improvement of the health of the humankind.</AbstractText>
