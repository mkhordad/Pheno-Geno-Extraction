<AbstractText>Overt anti-ribosomal P (anti-P) autoantibodies are restricted to a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and are potentially pathogenic. Covert anti-P are detected in all other individuals. An idiotype (Id) network is nonoperational in those with overt anti-P, whereas it is functional in all others. The aim of this study was to produce a murine monoclonal (mAb) anti-Id to characterize the anti-P Id network in SLE. BALB/c mice were immunized with F(ab')(2) fragments of IgG anti-P from a patient with a broadly cross-reactive Id. One mAb was chosen (mAb41) that reacted preferentially to the immunogen. This IgG1 mAb bound comparably in ELISAs to affinity-purified anti-P from 11 SLE patients with overt anti-P. This binding was partially inhibited with ribosomal P antigen. In contrast, it did not bind to affinity-purified control autoantibodies, nor to normal human IgG. mAb41 inhibited anti-P binding to ribosomal P antigen in immunoassays and on Jurkat cells. No change was detected in patients' anti-P antibodies over time when mAb41 was used in Id-specific ELISAs. We conclude that mAb41 is an anti-Id that recognizes a public idiotope within the antigen-combining site of anti-P antibodies. Thus, it is analogous to its human counterparts, and potentially, would modulate the pathogenicity of anti-P autoantibodies in vivo.</AbstractText>
