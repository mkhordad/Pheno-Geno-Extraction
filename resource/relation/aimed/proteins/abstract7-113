<ArticleTitle>Characterisation of human <prot>peroxisomal <prot>2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase</prot></prot>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Based on the primary structure of the rat <prot>peroxisomal <prot>2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase</prot></prot> (M. Fransen, P.P. Van Veldhoven, S. Subramani, Biochem. J. 340 (1999) 561-568), the cDNA of the human counterpart was cloned. It contained an open reading frame of 878 bases encoding a protein of 291 amino acids (calculated molecular mass 30778 Da), being 83% identical to the rat reductase. The gene, encompassing nine exons, is located at chromosome 16p13. Bacterially expressed poly(His)-tagged reductase was active not only towards short and medium chain 2,4-dienoyl-CoAs, but also towards 2,4,7,10,13,16,19-docosaheptaenoyl-CoA. Hence, the reductase does not seem to constitute a rate limiting step in the peroxisomal degradation of docosahexaenoic acid. The reduction of docosaheptaenoyl-CoA, however, was severely decreased in the presence of albumin.</AbstractText>
