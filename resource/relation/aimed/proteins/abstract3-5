<ArticleTitle>Diva/Boo is a negative regulator of cell death in human glioma cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Diva is a novel proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family which binds apoptosis activating factor-1 (APAF-1). Diva is identical with Boo which was identified as a novel antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. Here, we report that Diva promotes the cell cycle exit of human glioma cells in response to serum deprivation and inhibits apoptosis of these cells induced by CD95 ligand or chemotherapeutic drugs. In glioma cells, Diva interferes with apoptotic signaling downstream of cytochrome c release, but upstream of caspase activation, consistent with an inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial amplification step involving the apoptosome and APAF-1.</AbstractText>
