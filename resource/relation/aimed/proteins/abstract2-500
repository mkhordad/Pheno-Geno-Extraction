<AbstractText>Spontaneous ruptures of the spleen have been observed in donors and patients with malignancy during mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells. Thus, we investigated the morphological and histological alteration of the spleen, and mRNA expression levels and activities of the DNA-synthesizing enzymes thymidylate synthase (TS) and thymidine kinase (TK) in the splenic cells, of rats treated with recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Daily injections of rhG-CSF for 5 or 7 days slightly enhanced the splenic weight. Single or 3-day treatment with rhG-CSF markedly enhanced the number of granulocytes in peripheral blood. Expression levels of TS and TK mRNA in the splenic cells were significantly increased 6 hours after rhG-CSF treatment. Early expression of TS and TK mRNA in the splenic cells may indicate a reseeding of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow. Daily injections with rhG-CSF enhanced the TS and TK activities in the splenic cells. As continuous elevations of DNA-synthesizing enzyme activity and spleno-megaly are suggestive of a possible splenic rupture, the monitoring of peripheral granulocytes and splenic size is necessary during the rhG-CSF treatment.</AbstractText>
