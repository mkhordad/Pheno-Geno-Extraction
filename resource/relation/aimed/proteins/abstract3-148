<AbstractText>In a study of 180 twin pregnancies I have examined the distribution of maternal serum free <prot>beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin</prot> (<prot>beta-hCG</prot>) and <prot>pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A</prot> (<prot>PAPP-A</prot>), in addition to fetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT), in twins classified as monochorionic or dichorionic, based on ultrasound appearance at 10-14 weeks of gestation. In 45 monochorionic and 135 dichorionic twin pregnancies the median MoM free <prot>beta-hCG</prot> was not significantly different (1.00 vs 1.01), whilst that for <prot>PAPP-A</prot> was lower (0.89 vs 1.01) but again with no statistical significance. Previous reports of an increased fetal NT in monochorionic twins pregnancies could not be confirmed (1.03 vs 1.00). It is concluded that the existing pseudo risk twin correction algorithm is appropriate for both monochorionic and dichorionic twins in providing accurate first trimester risks for trisomy 21.</AbstractText>
