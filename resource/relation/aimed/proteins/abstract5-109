<AbstractText>Neurosonography is used as a primary imaging modality worldwide for visualization of the developing brain and spinal cord in fetuses, infants and children. During the entire process of brain development, there is rapid cell turnover, a condition that is favorable for genetic mutations once external stimuli are applied. No clinical studies in humans have been performed specifically to discuss the long-term impact of postnatal ultrasound exposure of the central nervous system. Currently published studies concerning the prenatal and postnatal use of Doppler or of ultrasound contrast agent use and the developing central nervous system are insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions regarding safety. By instituting a standardized examination and following appropriate patient handling guidelines, the risk of an adverse outcome associated with neurosonography is minimized. This paper recommends adoption of the ALARA principle and offers suggestions as to how to minimize the risk of adverse effects in neurosonography.</AbstractText>
