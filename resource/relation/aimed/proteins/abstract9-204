<AbstractText>GT160-246, a high-molecular-weight soluble anionic polymer, was tested in vitro and in vivo for neutralization of Clostridium difficile toxin A and B activities. Five milligrams of GT160-246 per ml neutralized toxin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis in Vero cells induced by 5 ng of toxin A per ml or 1.25 ng of toxin B per ml. In ligated rat ileal loops, 1 mg of GT160-246 neutralized fluid accumulation caused by 5 microg of toxin A. At doses as high as 80 mg/loop, cholestyramine provided incomplete neutralization of fluid accumulation caused by 5 microg of toxin A. GT160-246 protected 80% of the hamsters from mortality caused by infection with C. difficile, whereas cholestyramine protected only 10% of animals. Treatment of C. difficile-infected hamsters with metronidazole initially protected 100% of the hamsters from mortality, but upon removal of treatment, 80% of the hamsters had relapses and died. In contrast, removal of GT160-246 treatment did not result in disease relapse in the hamsters. GT160-246 showed no antimicrobial activity in tests with a panel of 16 aerobic bacteria and yeast and 22 anaerobic bacteria and did not interfere with the in vitro activities of most antibiotics. GT160-246 offers a novel, nonantimicrobial treatment of C. difficile disease in humans.</AbstractText>
