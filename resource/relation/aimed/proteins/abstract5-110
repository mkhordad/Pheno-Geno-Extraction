<AbstractText>The aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of a novel forward-viewing intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) technique for three-dimensional imaging of severely stenosed or totally occluded vessels, where the conventional side-viewing IVUS systems are of limited use. A stiff 3.8 mm diameter forward-viewing catheter was manufactured to scan a 72 degrees sector ahead of its tip. Conical volume data were acquired by rotating the catheter over 180 degrees by means of a motorised mechanical system. Operating at 30 MHz, the catheter was integrated with an IVUS scanner and a radiofrequency data acquisition system. Postmortem carotid and femoral arteries were scanned in vitro. Correlation of the reconstructed images with histology demonstrated the ability of this forward-viewing IVUS system to visualise healthy lumens, bifurcations, thickened atherosclerotic walls and, most importantly, severe and complete vessel occlusions. A rotating-sector forward-viewing IVUS system is suitable for anatomical assessment of severely diseased vessels in three dimensions.</AbstractText>
