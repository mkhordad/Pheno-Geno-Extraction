<AbstractText>Regulation of <prot>p85a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase</prot> (<prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot>) expression by <prot>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</prot> (<prot>PPAR</prot>) activators was studied in human skeletal muscle cells. Activation of <prot>PPARgamma</prot> or <prot>PPARbeta</prot> did not modify the expression of <prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot>. In contrast, activation of <prot>PPARalpha</prot> increased <prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot> mRNA. This effect was potentiated by 9-cis-retinoic acid, an activator of RXR. Up-regulation of <prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot> gene expression resulted in a rise in <prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot> protein level and in an increase in <prot>insulin</prot>-induced <prot>PI3-kinase</prot> activity. According to the role of <prot>p85alphaPI-3K</prot> in <prot>insulin</prot> action, these results suggest that drugs with dual action on both <prot>PPARgamma</prot> and <prot>PPARalpha</prot> can be of interest for the treatment of <prot>insulin</prot> resistance.</AbstractText>
