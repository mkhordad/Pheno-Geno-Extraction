<ArticleTitle>Influence of liposomal amphotericin B on <prot>CD8</prot> T-cell function.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Liposomal amphotericin B was immunosuppressive on target cell lysis in vitro and on protection mediated by cytotoxic <prot>CD8</prot> T cells in murine listeriosis. When dosages usually used for therapy in humans were compared, the immunosuppressive effect of 5 mg of liposomal amphotericin B/kg of body weight/day was similar to that of standard amphotericin B at 1 mg/kg/day, but a dosage of liposomal amphotericin B of 1 mg/kg/day was not suppressive in vivo.</AbstractText>
