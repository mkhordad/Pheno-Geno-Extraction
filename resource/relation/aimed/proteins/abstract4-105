<AbstractText>The mode of transmission of Helicobacter pylori is largely unknown and is a matter of circumstantial evidence and speculation rather than fact. However, the principle evidence is of two sorts: the epidemiological data, providing evidence of possible risk factors associated with transmission, and the identification of potential sources from which H. pylori could be acquired. Evidence exists for several potential sources of infection and several possible modes of transmission, and it is feasible that the transmission of H. pylori varies according to the cultural and demographic circumstances. However, the most likely recognized source for H. pylori is the human stomach, although it is not known by what route the organism is transmitted to the stomach. Evidence suggests close personal contact is important and that acquisition occurs mainly in childhood. This article reviews the evidence for the source of infection and the route of transmission of H. pylori.</AbstractText>
