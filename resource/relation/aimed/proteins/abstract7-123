<AbstractText>Redemocratization in the 1970s brought about changes in the public health system in Brazil. The Unified National Health System (SUS) was implemented in 1988, based on local and regional administrative systems. This was an important step that resulted in greater local control and the introduction of new technologies. This study focuses on the local health system in Campinas, a relatively affluent and technologically advanced region some 100km from the city of São Paulo in Southeast Brazil. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to evaluate the work of 233 nurses in the local health system. The first nurse was hired in 1977, and now there are 53 nurses working in specific areas: 10 in the central health administration, 36 in district administrations, and the rest in local services. Nursing services are organized in six main areas: administration, coordination of human resources, education, information technology, health surveillance, and health administration. Nursing intervention may be found in various areas, but it generally focuses on medical consultations, and there is little emphasis on collective activities and health promotion. Local health objectives can only be achieved by creating new practices that promote collective health.</AbstractText>
