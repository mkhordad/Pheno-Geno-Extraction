<AbstractText><prot>Lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)-1</prot>, one of the major protein components of the lysosomal membrane, is upregulated in the human glioblastoma cell lines, U-373 MG and LN-Z308, which undergo cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These human brain tumor cell lines demonstrated apoptosis in response to cisplatin/nifedipine treatment. Both cell lines demonstrated an apoptotic response by more than one criterion. Apoptosis was demonstrated by DNA fragmentation techniques such as DNA laddering, ApopTag in situ labeling, and an ELISA-based method of detecting liberated oligosomes. These cells also had characteristic morphologic changes and upregulation of bax consistent with apoptosis. <prot>LAMP-1</prot> expression at the protein and mRNA level was examined and found to increase with cisplatin/nifedipine treatment. <prot>LAMP-1</prot> expression was examined using indirect immunofluorescent staining, Northern blot analysis and Western blot analysis. The finding of an augmentation of <prot>LAMP-1</prot> in these cells induced to die is enigmatic. These findings raise the possibility of <prot>LAMP-1</prot> involvement in the apoptotic process.</AbstractText>
