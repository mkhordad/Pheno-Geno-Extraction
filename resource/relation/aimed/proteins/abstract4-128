<AbstractText>A wide variety of inhibitory and stimulatory <?>NK cell receptor</?>s are expressed by some <prot>CD8</prot>+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mice and humans. Recent data address the induction of these receptors on activated or memory <prot>CD8</prot>+ T cells and have led to hypotheses addressing their function in the <prot>CD8</prot>+ T cell response.</AbstractText>
