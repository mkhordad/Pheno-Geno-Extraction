<AbstractText>OBJECTIVE: To assess the advantages and disadvantages of a direct adenoviral and a cell-mediated approach to the induction of cartilage formation in joints by transfer of growth factor genes. METHODS: Adenoviral vectors carrying <prot>insulin-like growth factor 1</prot> (<prot>IGF-1</prot>) or <prot>bone morphogenetic protein 2</prot> (<prot>BMP-2</prot>) complementary DNA were constructed and applied to primary human and murine chondrocytes or fibroblasts. Transgene expression was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Direct injection of these vectors or AdLacZ, a reporter gene vector, into mouse knee joints was compared with the transplantation of syngeneic fibroblasts (infected ex vivo with the same vectors) with respect to virus spread, immune response, and cartilage formation by use of histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses. RESULTS: AdIGF-1 and AdBMP-2 efficiently infected all cell types tested. Human cells secreted biologically relevant levels of protein over a period of at least 28 days. Direct transfer of AdLacZ into mouse knee joints resulted in positively stained synovial tissues, whereas AdLacZ-infected fibroblasts settled on the surface of the synovial membranes. Inadvertent spread of vector DNA into the liver, lung, and spleen was identified by nested polymerase chain reaction in all mice that had received the vector directly; this rarely occurred following fibroblast-mediated gene transfer. Direct injection of AdBMP-2 induced the synthesis of new cartilage in periarticular mesenchyme, accompanied by extensive osteophyte formation. When AdBMP-2 was administered by injecting ex vivo-infected fibroblasts, cartilage formation was observed only in regions near the injected cells. AdIGF-1 treatment did not lead to morphologic changes. Importantly, fibroblast-mediated gene transfer avoided the strong immune response to adenovirus that was elicited following direct application of the vector. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that cell-mediated gene transfer provides sufficient <prot>BMP-2</prot> levels in the joint to induce cartilage formation while avoiding inadvertent vector spread and immune reactions.</AbstractText>
