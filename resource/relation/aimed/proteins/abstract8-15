<AbstractText>BACKGROUND: The generation of prostatic cell lines provides in vitro models for experimental studies of the pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma. Therefore, we established and characterized a new human prostate epithelial cell line, PEAZ-1 (prostate epithelial Arizona-1). METHODS: The PEAZ-1 cells were grown from a primary human prostate carcinoma specimen obtained from radical prostatectomy. The isolated cells were characterized by immunobiochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and tumorigenicity studies. RESULTS: PEAZ-1 cells are near diploid, tumorigenic, and androgen independent for cell growth. PEAZ-1 cells express <prot>N-cadherin</prot>, alpha- and <prot>beta-catenins</prot>, and <prot>p120</prot> at cell-cell contacts, <prot>cytoplasmic laminin 5</prot>, <prot>vinculin</prot>, <prot>paxillin</prot>, and <prot>phosphotyrosine</prot> at focal adhesions, <prot>vimentin</prot>, and <prot>cytokeratins 8</prot> and 18. They do not express <prot>plakoglobin</prot>, <prot>E-cadherin</prot>, and <prot>PSA</prot>, and do not form desmosomes and hemidesomomes. PEAZ-1 respond to ocadaic acid, a pro-apoptotic agent, by expression of <prot>p53</prot>. CONCLUSIONS: PEAZ-1 cells is a human prostate cancer cell line that has a number of mesenchymal characteristics.</AbstractText>
