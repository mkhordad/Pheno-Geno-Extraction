<AbstractText>The effects of (56)Fe particles and (137)Cs gamma radiation were compared in TK6 and WTK1 human lymphoblasts, two related cell lines which differ in TP53 status and in the ability to rejoin DNA double-strand breaks. Both cell lines were more sensitive to the cytotoxic and clastogenic effects of (56)Fe particles than to those of gamma rays. However, the mutagenicity of (56)Fe particles and gamma rays at the TK locus was the same per unit dose and was higher for gamma rays than for (56)Fe particles at isotoxic doses. The respective RBEs for TK6 and WTK1 cells were 1.5 and 1.9 for cytotoxicity and 2.5 and 1.9 for clastogenicity, but only 1 for mutagenicity. The results indicate that complex lesions induced by (56)Fe particles are repaired less efficiently than gamma-ray-induced lesions, leading to fewer colony-forming cells, a slightly higher proportion of aberrant cells at the first division, and a lower frequency of viable mutants at isotoxic doses. WTK1 cells (mutant TP53) were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of both gamma rays and (56)Fe particles, but showed greater cytogenetic and mutagenic damage than TK6 cells (TP53(+)). A deficiency in the number of damaged TK6 cells (a) reaching the first mitosis after exposure and (b) forming viable mutants can explain these results.</AbstractText>
