<AbstractText>Certain human cell lines and primary macrophage cultures are restricted to infection by some primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), although early steps of the viral life cycle such as fusion at the plasma membrane and reverse transcription are fully supported. The late postintegration events, transcription, translation, assembly, budding, and maturation into infectious virions are functional in restrictive cells. Apart from primary macrophages, the restrictive cell types are actively dividing, and nuclear import of preintegration complexes (PICs) is not required for infection. We therefore postulate that the PICs are trapped in a cellular compartment, preventing subsequent steps in the replication cycle that lead to integration of the provirus. To test this we showed that HIV-2 particles pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope G protein, which delivers HIV into an endocytic compartment, could overcome the block to infection. We suggest that delivery of the viral core into an appropriate cellular compartment is a critical step during the entry process of HIV.</AbstractText>
