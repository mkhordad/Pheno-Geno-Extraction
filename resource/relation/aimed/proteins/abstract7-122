<AbstractText>In order to identify intra- and extra-domiciliary triatomines, a study in different counties of Corrientes Province, Argentina, was conducted from 1985 to 1995. Triatoma infestans (Klug, 1834), Triatoma sordida (St√•l, 1859), Panstrongylus geniculatus (Latreille, 1811), and Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister, 1835) were detected in domestic ecotopes. T. infestans and T. sordida were also found in the peridomicile. Triatoma platensis (Neiva, 1913), Psammolestes coreodes (Bergroth, 1911), T. sordida, and Triatoma rubrovaria (Blanchard, 1843) were collected in sylvatic biotopes. T. infestans was confirmed as the predominant species in the domestic environment and was the only species infected with Trypanosoma cruzi-like parasites. T. sordida was most frequent in extra-domiciliary ecotopes, but could be considered capable of colonizing human dwellings.</AbstractText>
