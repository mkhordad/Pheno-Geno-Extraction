<AbstractText>Neural stem and precursor cells reside in the ventricular lining of the fetal forebrain, and may provide a cellular substrate for brain repair. To selectively identify and extract these cells, we infected dissociated fetal human brain cells with adenoviruses bearing the gene for <prot>green fluorescence protein</prot> (<prot>GFP</prot>), placed under the control of enhancer/promoters for two genes (<prot>nestin</prot> and <prot>musashi1</prot>) that are expressed in uncommitted neuroepithelial cells. The cells were then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of E/<prot>nestin</prot>- or P/<prot>musashi1</prot>-driven <prot>GFP</prot> expression. Both P/<prot>musashi1</prot>:<prot>hGFP</prot>- and E/<prot>nestin</prot>:<prot>EGFP</prot>-sorted cells were multipotent: limiting dilution with clonal expansion as neurospheres, in tandem with retroviral lineage analysis and xenograft to E17 and P0-2 rat forebrain, revealed that each phenotype was able to both self-renew and co-generate neurons and glia. Thus, fluorescent genes placed under the control of early neural promoters allow neural stem cells to be specifically targeted, isolated, and substantially enriched from the fetal human brain.</AbstractText>
