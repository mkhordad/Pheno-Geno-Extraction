<AbstractText>Homocystinuria is a metabolic disorder associated with an increased incidence of vascular disease. Here, we analyzed the effects of homocysteine on endothelial cell activation that is a prerequisite for the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of evolving atherosclerotic plaques. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to homocysteine alone did not modulate expression of the adhesion molecules <prot>E-selectin</prot>, <prot>intercellular adhesion molecule-1</prot> and <prot>vascular cell adhesion molecule-1</prot>, and the chemokines <prot>monocyte chemotactic protein-1</prot> and <prot>interleukin-8</prot>. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced upregulation of these molecules was almost completely inhibited by homocysteine, but not by related thiol amino acids. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and reporter gene assays, the inhibitory effect of homocysteine could be attributed to inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of <prot>NF-kappa B</prot>. TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of <prot>I kappa B-alpha</prot>, however, were not affected. Neither was <prot>NF-kappa B</prot>-independent activation of endothelial cells by <prot>interferon-gamma</prot> influenced by homocysteine. In summary, our data indicate that homocysteine alters the response to injury of endothelial cells which may have fundamental impacts on mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation. Our findings might refer to a novel pathway by which homocysteine is involved in vascular disorders associated with homocystinuria.</AbstractText>
