<AbstractText>PURPOSE: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-related malignancy. Pulmonary involvement by KS (PKS) has carried a poor prognosis with median reported survival ranging from 3 to 10 months. We studied whether the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; triple antiretroviral therapy including a protease inhibitor and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors) has been associated with improved survival for AIDS patients with PKS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 37 consecutive patients with PKS and human immunodeficiency virus infection in the tumor registry at a large municipal hospital in New York City between 1994 to 1997. There were 16 patients from 1994 to 1995 (pre-HAART period) and 21 patients from 1996 to 1997 (post-HAART period). The primary end point was survival, which was defined as time from start of chemotherapy until death from any cause. RESULTS: Patients were analyzed by the date of diagnosis (pre- v post-HAART period) and whether or not they received HAART. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly better survival in patients diagnosed in the post-HAART period (P =.0025). Additional Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients on HAART had substantially better survival (P &#60;.0001). Cox multivariate analyses showed that HAART therapy was associated with a reduced risk of death (hazard ratio = 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.69). CONCLUSION: In patients with AIDS-associated PKS and undergoing chemotherapy, administration of HAART was associated with increased survival.</AbstractText>
