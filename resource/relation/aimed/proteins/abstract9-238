<AbstractText>A gelatin sponge was formed by foaming and heat treating a gelatin solution, followed by coating the solid with poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) to reinforce the gelatin framework. This sponge was tested for its suitability as a biodegradable porous, recombinant human <prot>bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2</prot> carrier. Incorporation of rh <prot>BMP-2</prot> into the sponge was closely related to its bulk density of gelatin sponge. The calcium content in the sponges, as assessed by an ectopic bone formation assay in rats, increased with the increasing sponge bulk density. Histologic and peripheral quantitative computed tomography analysis of implants in this ectopic assay system revealed cell growth throughout the carrier in 4 weeks after implantation regardless gelatin bulk density. The carrier containing rh <prot>BMP-2</prot> maintained its three-dimensional structure after implantation; the carrier resisted collapse caused by soft tissue pressure during rapid bone formation as assessed by soft X-ray photographs. These results indicate that this newly developed sponge has excellent carrier characteristics to introduce rh <prot>BMP-2</prot> into areas needed for bone regeneration.</AbstractText>
