<AbstractText>Conventional allografting produces considerable regimen-related toxicities that generally limit this treatment to patients younger than 55 years and in otherwise good medical condition. T cell-mediated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects are known to play an important role in the elimination of malignant disease after allotransplants. A minimally myelosuppressive regimen that relies on immunosuppression for allogeneic engraftment was developed to reduce toxicities while optimizing GVT effects. Pre-transplant total-body irradiation (200 cGy) followed by post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) permitted human <prot>leukocyte antigen</prot> (<prot>HLA</prot>)-matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell engraftment in 82% of patients (n = 55) without prior high-dose therapy. The addition of fludarabine (90 mg/m2) facilitated engraftment in all 28 subsequent patients. Overall, fatal progression of underlying disease occurred in 20% of patients after transplant. Non-relapse mortality occurred in 11% of patients. Toxicities were low. Grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with primary engraftment developed in 47% of patients, and was readily controlled in all but two patients. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were not very effective at converting a low degree of mixed donor/host chimerism to full donor chimerism; however, the addition of fludarabine reduced the need for DLI. With a median follow-up of 244 days, 68% of patients were alive, with 42% of patients in complete remission, including molecular remissions. Remissions occurred gradually over periods of weeks to a year. If long-term efficacy is demonstrated, such a strategy would expand treatment options for patients who would otherwise be excluded from conventional allografting.</AbstractText>
