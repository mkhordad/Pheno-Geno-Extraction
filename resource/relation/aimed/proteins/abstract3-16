<AbstractText><prot>CENP-C</prot> is an evolutionarily conserved centromere protein that is thought to be an important component in kinetochore assembly in vertebrate cells. However, the functional role of <prot>CENP-C</prot> in cell cycle progression remains unclear. To further understand <prot>CENP-C</prot> function, we developed a method incorporating the hyper-recombinogenic chicken B lymphocyte cell line DT40 to create several temperature-sensitive <prot>CENP-C</prot> mutants in DT40 cells. We found that, under restrictive conditions, one temperature-sensitive mutant, ts4-11, displayed metaphase delay and chromosome missegregation but proceeded through the cell cycle until arrest at G(1) phase. Furthermore, ts4-11 cells were transfected with a human HeLa cell cDNA library maintained in a retroviral vector, and genes that suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype were identified. One of these suppressor genes encodes <prot>SUMO-1</prot>, which is a ubiquitin-like protein. This finding suggests that <prot>SUMO-1</prot> may be involved in centromere function in vertebrate cells. The novel strategy reported here will be useful and applicable to a wide range of proteins that have general cell-autonomous function in vertebrate cells.</AbstractText>
