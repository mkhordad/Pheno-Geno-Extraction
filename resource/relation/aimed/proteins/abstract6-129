<AbstractText>Several in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated potent cell regulatory effects of vitamin D compounds in cancer cells. Moreover, a promising phase I study with the vitamin D analogue Seocalcitol (EB 1089) in patients with advanced breast and colon cancer has already been carried out and more clinical trials evaluating the clinical effectiveness of EB 1089 in other cancer types are in progress (MÃ¸rk Hansen et al. [2000a]). However, only little is known about the mechanisms underlying the actions of vitamin D or about the possible development of drug resistance in the patients. Therefore, in an attempt to gain more insight into these aspects, we have developed the MCF-7/VD(R) cell line, a stable subclone of the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which is resistant to the growth inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effects of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Despite this characteristic, receptor studies on the VDR have clearly demonstrated that the MCF-7/VD(R) cells contain fully functional VDRs, although in a lower number than seen with the parental MCF-7 cells. The regulation of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme appeared to be intact in the MCF-7/VD(R) cells and no differences with regard to growth rate and morphological appearance between the MCF-7/VD(R) cells and the parental MCF-7 cells were observed. Interestingly, however, the sensitivity of the MCF-7/VD(R) cells to the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 was found to be increased. The MCF-7/VD(R) cell line shows characteristics different from those of previously described vitamin D resistant breast cancer cell lines but also some similarities. Together such vitamin D resistant cell lines therefore serve as a useful tool for studying the exact mechanism of action of vitamin D and the development of vitamin D resistance.</AbstractText>
