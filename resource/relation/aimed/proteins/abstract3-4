<AbstractText>The binding of peptides, derived from the model substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, to the human cyclophilin hCyp-18 was investigated. HCyp-18 is able to bind 2-4-mer peptides as well as shorter para-nitroaniline (pNA) derivatives and pNA surrogates. Although Suc-Ala-Phe-pNA binds hCyp-18, only proline-containing peptides are able to block efficiently the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. Competition experiments strongly suggest the existence of two independent subsites: a S1' 'proline' subsite and a S2'-S3' 'pNA' subsite. The interaction at S2'-S3' requires either a Phe-pNA C-terminus or a Phe-pNA surrogate bearing an H-bond acceptor able to bind Trp121 and Arg148 simultaneously.</AbstractText>
