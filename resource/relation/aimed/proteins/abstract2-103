<AbstractText><prot>The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) envelope protein</prot> is required for virus spread. This study further characterizes the role of the envelope protein in HTLV-1 immortalization. Viruses with single amino acid substitutions within the SU protein at residue 75, 81, 95, 101, 105, or 195 or with a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain truncation (CT), as well as an envelope-null (EN) virus, were generated within an infectious molecular clone, ACH. Transfection of 293T cells resulted in the release of similar amounts of virus particles from all of the mutants as determined by p19 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis of Gag in cell lysates and supernatants. The virus particles from all mutants except ACH-101, ACH-CT, and ACH-EN were infectious for B5 macaque cells in cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission assays and were capable of immortalizing transfected <prot>CD4</prot>(+) lymphocytes. These results indicate that HTLV-1 spread is required for immortalization.</AbstractText>
