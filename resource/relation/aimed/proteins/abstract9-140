<AbstractText>Human natural killer (NK) cells are able to adhere to xenogeneic porcine endothelial cells (EC) and evidence from in vitro studies as well as animal models suggests a potential role for NK cells in the cellular recognition and damage of porcine xenogeneic tissues. One possible explanation for the observed NK cell-mediated xenogeneic cytotoxicity against porcine EC is the molecular incompatibility between porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and MHC-specific inhibitory receptors on human NK cells. In this review we attempt to summarize the current knowledge concerning adhesive interactions between human NK cells and porcine EC under special considerations of the cross-species receptor-ligand interactions. Methodological differences in assessing adhesion between various studies are reviewed and comparisons to the syngeneic/allogeneic adhesion mechanisms are made. Finally, the therapeutic potential of blocking antibodies and transgenic HLA expression in preventing NK-cell adhesion and xenogeneic cytotoxicity is discussed.</AbstractText>
