<ArticleTitle>Structure and chromosomal localization of chicken <prot>CD5</prot>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><prot>CD5</prot> is a transmembrane glycoprotein on all T cells and on a subpopulation of B cells. Based on the analysis of chicken <prot>CD5</prot>-cDNA we have previously shown that the structure of the <prot>CD5</prot> protein is conserved between species. Here we report the isolation and chromosomal mapping of the chicken <prot>CD5</prot> gene. The gene spans 3.4 kb and is extremely compact with a high GC-nucleotide content. There are 10 exons and the introns are spliced out similarly to those in the human <prot>CD5</prot> gene. Each of the three extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains is encoded as an exon of its own, as is the proline-rich hinge region that separates the first two membrane-distal SRCR domains. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was used to map the gene to chromosome five. This is the first report describing the organization of the <prot>CD5</prot> gene from a nonmammalian species.</AbstractText>
