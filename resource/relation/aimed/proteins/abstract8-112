<ArticleTitle>Expression of <prot>membrane <prot>C1q</prot></prot> in human monocyte-derived macrophages is developmentally regulated and enhanced by <prot>interferon-gamma</prot>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The present study investigated when during "in vitro" maturation macrophages (MPhi) express <prot>membrane <prot>C1q</prot></prot> (<prot>mC1q</prot>), and whether cell activation affects expression and function of <prot>mC1q</prot>. Although <prot>C1q</prot> mRNA was repeatedly detected in freshly isolated monocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, <prot>C1q</prot> protein was observed only in developing MPhi from day 1 to 4 on using immunodetection and flow cytometry. However, the quantity of <prot>mC1q</prot> and other MPhi membrane proteins differed strikingly in cells from different donors. We report here for the first time that <prot>CD14</prot>(+) and <prot>CD14</prot>(-) <prot>mC1q</prot>-bearing MPhi can develop, and that <prot>interferon-gamma</prot> increases <prot>mC1q</prot> display at the cell surface, and <prot>mC1q</prot>-mediated phagocytosis.</AbstractText>
