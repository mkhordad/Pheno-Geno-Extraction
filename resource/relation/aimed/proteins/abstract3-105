<ArticleTitle>Human <prot>methionine synthase reductase</prot>, a soluble P-450 reductase-like dual flavoprotein, is sufficient for NADPH-dependent <prot>methionine synthase</prot> activation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><prot>Methionine synthase</prot> is a key enzyme in the methionine cycle that catalyzes the transmethylation of homocysteine to methionine in a cobalamin-dependent reaction that utilizes methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl group donor. <prot>Cob(I)alamin</prot>, a supernucleophilic form of the cofactor, is an intermediate in this reaction, and its reactivity renders the enzyme susceptible to oxidative inactivation. In bacteria, an NADPH-dependent two-protein system comprising <prot>flavodoxin reductase</prot> and <prot>flavodoxin</prot>, transfers electrons during reactivation of <prot>methionine synthase</prot>. Until recently, the physiological reducing system in mammals was unknown. Identification of mutations in the gene encoding a putative <prot><prot>methionine synthase</prot> reductase</prot> in the cblE class of patients with an isolated functional deficiency of <prot>methionine synthase</prot> suggested a role for this protein in activation (Leclerc, D., Wilson, A., Dumas, R., Gafuik, C., Song, D., Watkins, D., Heng, H. H. Q., Rommens, J. M., Scherer, S. W., Rosenblatt, D. S., and Gravel, R. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 3059-3064). In this study, we have cloned and expressed the cDNA encoding human <prot><prot>methionine synthase</prot> reductase</prot> and demonstrate that it is sufficient for supporting NADPH-dependent activity of <prot>methionine synthase</prot> at a level that is comparable with that seen in the in vitro assay that utilizes artificial reductants. <prot><prot>Methionine synthase</prot> reductase</prot> is a soluble, monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 78 kDa. It is a member of the family of dual flavoproteins and is isolated with an equimolar concentration of FAD and FMN. Reduction by NADPH results in the formation of an air stable semiquinone similar to that observed with <prot>cytochrome P-450 reductase</prot>. <prot>Methionine synthase reductase</prot> reduces cytochrome c in an NADPH-dependent reaction at a rate (0.44 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) at 25 degrees C) that is comparable with that reported for <prot>NR1</prot>, a soluble dual flavoprotein of unknown function, but is approximately 100-fold slower than that of <prot>P-450 reductase</prot>. The K(m) for NADPH is 2.6 +/- 0.5 microm, and the K(act) for <prot><prot>methionine synthase</prot> reductase</prot> is 80.7 +/- 13.7 nm for NADPH-dependent activity of <prot>methionine synthase</prot>.</AbstractText>
