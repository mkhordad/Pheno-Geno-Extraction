<AbstractText>Mammalian spermatogenesis shows a strict control of many specific molecular and cellular events. This control involves Sertoli cell-germ cell interaction, as well as a programmed performance of changes in chromatin structure and gene expression in the developing germ cells. In recent years, much knowledge about the functions of defined genes in spermatogenesis has been gained by making use of mouse transgenic and gene knockout models. Several of these models are discussed in this brief overview, with an emphasis on genes encoding proteins involved in the control of gene transcription, mRNA translation, DNA repair and protein ubiquitination. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of spermatogenesis in the mouse may provide concepts that can improve our understanding of human male infertility and may also lead to the identification of novel targets for contraceptive intervention.</AbstractText>
