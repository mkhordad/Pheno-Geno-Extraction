<AbstractText>Three highly homologous homeobox genes (<prot>caupolican</prot>, <prot>araucan</prot> and <prot>mirror</prot>) have been identified in Drosophila. These genes belong to the novel <prot>Iroquois</prot> complex, which acts as a pre-pattern molecule in Drosophila neurogenesis. Recently several vertebrate <prot>Iroquois</prot> homologues (<prot>Irx</prot>) were isolated and found to be involved in pattern formation of various tissues. Here we report cytogenetic mapping of four human and five chicken <prot>Iroquois</prot> genes by FISH. Our findings revealed that vertebrate <prot>Irx</prot> genes are clustered at two different loci.</AbstractText>
