<AbstractText>The aim of blood transfusion therapy is to supply specific labile products to patients in quality and in quantity. Different basic blood products are available: red blood cell concentrates, platelets concentrates and fresh frozen plasma, and according to their biological parameters, some of them can be selected and secondly adapted. Therefore, because some blood products are very rare and expensive, it is not possible to systematically use blood products having all the specifications. Also, it is necessary for clinicians to know blood product indications in order to avoid inadapted and abusive prescriptions inducing blood product unavailability damaging for other patients. The benefice risk ratio must be continuously measured, because these human products have some adverse effects: specially immunologic reactions and transfusion transmitted diseases. The systematic cell blood product leukoreduction since April 1st 1998 in France, allowed us to decrease these risks and to obtain a good tolerance. The hypothetical prion blood product transmission must be taken into consideration by plasma leukoreduction and limiting the blood product transfused number, in the respect of each specific clinical situation.</AbstractText>
