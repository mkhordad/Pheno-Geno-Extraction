<AbstractText>BACKGROUND: Occupational exposure to methylene chloride, together with carboxyhemoglobin concentrations, has not been studied previously. METHODS: Carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured in non-smoking employees exposed to varying concentrations of methylene chloride during the manufacture of cellulose triacetate fibers. The observed carboxyhemoglobin levels were compared to predicted concentrations using a pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: The presence of carboxyhemoglobin in non-smokers exposed to methylene chloride results primarily from the metabolism of methylene chloride in the liver and exhibits a linear dose-response relationship. The observed levels of carboxyhemoglobin in non-smokers at the end of an 8-hour shift depend upon exposures to methylene chloride that day but are independent of occupational exposures on previous days. The observed daily concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin are consistent with predicted concentrations using a pharmacokinetic model. While varying exposure patterns were shown to change the rate of metabolite formation at the end of shift, these same exposure patterns had almost no effect on the total amount of carbon monoxide in the blood. CONCLUSION: While the present study addresses the relationship between methylene chloride, carbon monoxide, carboxyhemoglobin and ischemic heart disease, it does not address the issue of tumorigenicity, which is also the basis for the current U.S. Occupational Health and Safety workplace exposure limit of 25 ppm. This study provides support for the conclusion that the current American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists 8-hour Threshold Limit Value of 50 ppm adequately protects human health with regard to ischemic heart disease and carboxyhemoglobin formation among non-smokers.</AbstractText>
