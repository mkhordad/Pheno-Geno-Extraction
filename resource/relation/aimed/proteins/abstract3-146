<AbstractText>Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) <prot>E2</prot> glycoprotein (HCV/<prot>E2</prot>) is the most promising candidate for the development of an effective anti-HCV vaccine. Identification of the human epitopes that are conserved among isolates and are able to elicit protective antibodies would constitute a significant step forward. This work describes the mapping of the B-cell epitopes present on the surface of HCV/<prot>E2</prot>, as recognized by the immune system during infection, by the analysis of the reciprocal interactions of a panel of human recombinant Fabs derived from an HCV-infected patient. Three unrelated epitopes recognized by antibodies with no neutralization-of-binding (NOB) activity were identified; a fourth, major epitope was defined as a clustering of minor epitopes recognized by Fabs endowed with strong NOB activity.</AbstractText>
