<AbstractText>Special interest in the role of DHEA dates back to the finding of a correlation between low serum DHEA concentrations and a higher morbidity and mortality rate due to coronary diseases in humans. Animal studies with experimental atherosclerosis confirmed the anti-sclerotic effect of DHEA. The mechanism of DHEA action remains unclear. We determined the influence of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration, a potential anti-atherogenic agent, on platelet aggregation, platelet <prot>superoxide dismutase</prot> (<prot>SOD</prot>) activity and serum lipid peroxide (LPO) levels in male rabbits fed on a normal and atherogenic diet. 44 adult male New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 4 groups: 1--control group fed on standard rabbit food, 2--fed on an atherogenic diet, 3--fed on an atherogenic diet with DHEA, 4--fed on standard food with DHEA. We detected blood platelet aggregation following (ADP) and collagen activation by means of photometry. Platelet <prot>SOD</prot> activity was detected by means of fluorometry determining the inhibition of adrenaline auto-oxidation. The serum LPO concentration was measured by means of the colorimetric method. The serum DHEA-S concentration was measured by means of RIA methods, and serum lipid levels were measured by means of Biom√©rieux manufactured kits. Results demonstrate that (1) elevated LPO concentrations in rabbits with hyperlipidemia did not decrease following DHEA administration. (2) In rabbits fed on a normal diet, DHEA caused a decrease of LPO, which emphasizes the positive influence of this steroid on the oxidative stress in healthy animals. Such a result was not seen in the group with severe hyperlipidemia. (3) Rabbits with hyperlipidemia demonstrated a significantly decreased <prot>SOD</prot> activity. (4) In healthy animals as well as in those with hyperlipidemia, DHEA administration caused an increase of platelet <prot>SOD</prot> activity, the main enzyme of the antioxidant defence system, which protects the organism against free radical damage (5) (DHEA had no influence on platelets aggregation in both tested groups). In conclusion: DHEA administration improves platelet <prot>SOD</prot> activity, which protects cells against oxidative damage. The hypothesis that DHEA administration leads to an increase in antioxidant potency requires further investigations.</AbstractText>
