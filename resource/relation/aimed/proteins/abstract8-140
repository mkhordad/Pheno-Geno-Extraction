<AbstractText>The RT-PCR method was employed to determine the cytokine mRNA expression of human peripheral lymphocytes induced by the Japanese herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9). The results showed that the mRNA expression of <prot>IL-12</prot>, <prot>IL-1beta</prot>, <prot>IL-10</prot>, <prot>TNF-alpha</prot>, <prot>G-CSF</prot>, and <prot>IFN-gamma</prot> increased after 6 hr in culture. This is the first reported finding that TJ-9 is an <prot>IFN-gamma</prot> inducer. Next, cytokine mRNA expression was semi-quantitatively measured using the Gel Doc system with a CCD camera and then statistically analyzed in order to determine which component of TJ-9 was the true cytokine inducer. The results showed that the scutellaria root is the main component inducing the cytokines, while the glycyrrhiza root is the secondary component. When the cytokine concentrations in the supernatants of cell cultures were measured by ELISA, the levels of <prot>IL-12</prot>, <prot>IL-1beta</prot>, <prot>IL-10</prot>, <prot>TNF-alpha</prot>, and <prot>G-CSF</prot> reflected mRNA expression levels in the cell fraction. However, the level of <prot>IFN-gamma</prot> was below the detectable limit. The effects of various reagents on many different kinds of cytokine mRNA expression could be analyzed objectively in a short time using the Gel Doc system. Many important findings could be demonstrated by this simple, easy, sensitive, and cheap method. After the clinical significance of cytokine analysis is confirmed, this method may become a useful clinical examination tool.</AbstractText>
