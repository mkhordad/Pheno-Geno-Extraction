<AbstractText>A series of lipophilic soft drugs structurally related to the nonclassical <prot>dihydrofolate reductase</prot> (<prot>DHFR</prot>) inhibitors trimetrexate and piritrexim have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated in <prot>DHFR</prot> assays, with special emphasis on the inhibition of P. carinii <prot>DHFR</prot>. The best inhibitors, encompassing an ester bond in the bridge connecting the two aromatic systems, were approximately 10 times less potent than trimetrexate and piritrexim. The metabolites were designed to be poor inhibitors. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of three ligands in complex with <prot>DHFR</prot> from Pneumocystis carinii and from the human enzyme were conducted in order to better understand the factors determining the selectivity. A correct ranking of the relative inhibition of <prot>DHFR</prot> was achieved utilizing the linear interaction energy method. The soft drugs are intended for local administration. One representative ester was selected for a pharmacokinetic study in rats where it was found to undergo fast metabolic degradation to the predicted inactive metabolites.</AbstractText>
