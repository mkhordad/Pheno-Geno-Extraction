<AbstractText>H(2)O(2) and other reactive oxygen species are key regulators of many intracellular pathways. Within mammalian skin, H(2)O(2) is formed as a byproduct of melanin synthesis, and following u.v. irradiation. We therefore analyzed its effects on melanin synthesis. The activity of the rate-limiting melanogenic enzyme, <prot>tyrosinase</prot>, decreased in H(2)O(2)-treated mouse and human melanoma cells. This inhibition was concentration- and time-dependent in the B16 melanoma model. Maximal inhibition (50-75%) occurred 8-16 hours after a 20 minute exposure to 0.5 mM H(2)O(2). B16 cells withstand this treatment adequately, as shown by a small effect on glutathione levels and a rapid recovery of basal lipid peroxidation levels. Enzyme activities also recovered, beginning to increase 16-20 hours after the treatment. Inhibition of enzyme activities reflected decreased protein levels. mRNAs for <prot>tyrosinase</prot>, <prot>tyrosinase-related protein 1</prot>, <prot>dopachrome tautomerase</prot>, <prot>silver protein</prot> and <prot>melanocortin 1 receptor</prot> also decreased after H(2)O(2) treatment, and recovered at different rates. Downregulation of melanocyte differentiation markers mRNAs was preceded by a decrease in <prot>microphthalmia transcription factor</prot> (<prot>Mitf</prot>) gene expression, which was quantitatively similar to the decrease achieved using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Recovery of basal <prot>Mitf</prot> mRNA levels was also observed clearly before that of <prot>tyrosinase</prot>. Therefore, oxidative stress may lead to hypopigmentation by mechanisms that include a microphthalmia-dependent downregulation of the melanogenic enzymes.</AbstractText>
