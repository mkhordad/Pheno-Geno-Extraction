<AbstractText>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study clinico-investigative profile of 12 young (&#60;45 years) patients with stroke who tested positive for anti phospholipid antibodies (APLA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The diagnostic, clinical, laboratory and radiologic features in 12 APLA positive young patients who presented with stroke were studied. The APLA analysis included estimation of <prot>anticardiolipin</prot> (<prot>aCL</prot>) antibodies and <prot>lupus anticoagulant</prot> (<prot>LA</prot>). Other relevant tests included anti-nuclear antibody, human immunodeficiency virus, Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory, platelet count, echocardiography and carotid Doppler. APLA positive strokes were those cases where either the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were raised or <prot>LA</prot> was positive, and other known causes were excluded. RESULTS: Levels of IgG (<prot>aCL</prot>) was raised in 11 cases (mild 7, moderate 1, high 3), IgM was elevated in all the 12 cases (moderate 2, high 10). Of the two LA positive cases both were IgM positive but in one IgG was negative. Five patients showed small multiple bilateral cerebral infarcts on computerised tomography (CT) scan. 5 patients had history of recurrent strokes. Hemiparesis was more frequent than hemiplegia. None presented with dense hemiplegia. All patients recovered to normal functional capacity and did not have recurrence on drugs. CONCLUSION: A preliminary study on APLA positive young strokes showed certain clinical and radiological features, mild to moderate stroke, pre-treatment recurrences, multiple smaller infarcts on CT, which could be clustered in a subgroup of stroke in young. Incidentally these patients showed a good prognosis in terms of long term outcome.</AbstractText>
