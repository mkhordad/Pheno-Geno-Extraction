<AbstractText>In many types of cancer, <prot>p53</prot> frequently accumulates in tumor cells and anti-<prot>p53</prot> antibodies can be detected. However, only four CD8(+) T-cell epitopes from <prot>p53</prot> have been identified in humans so far. To further analyze the development of a T-cell response against <prot>p53</prot>, peptides having binding motifs specific for <prot>HLA-A1</prot>, -A2, -A3, -A24, -B7, -B35, -B44, and -B51 molecules have been defined. The HLA-binding capacity of those peptides was tested, and the stability of formed complexes was defined. Thirteen peptides that bound to <prot>HLA-A24</prot> and -B44 molecules are presented. The positive peptides were then used to detect the anti-p53 response of <prot>CD8</prot>(+) T lymphocytes from patients with bladder cancer. Six peptides, presented by <prot>HLA-A2</prot>, -B51, or -A24, were able to stimulate T cells from two patients (among 16) with tumor cells that strongly accumulated <prot>p53</prot>. On the contrary, <prot>p53</prot> peptides systematically failed to stimulate T cells from healthy donors or patients with low or undetectable levels of <prot>p53</prot> in their tumor cells. These results have led to the identification of four new potential <prot>T CD8</prot>(+) epitopes from <prot>p53</prot>: 194-203 associating with <prot>HLA-B51</prot> and 204-212, 211-218, and 235-243 associating with <prot>HLA-A24</prot>.</AbstractText>
