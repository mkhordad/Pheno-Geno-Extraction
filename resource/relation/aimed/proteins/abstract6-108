<AbstractText>Cigarette smoking continues to be one of the world's most important substance abuse problems. The widespread and persistent use of cigarettes is caused by the addictiveness of nicotine. A variety of human and animal studies have shown that nicotine can induce changes in hormonal balance in women. A clear understanding of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of nicotine may support changes in smoking behavior and exposure to tobacco toxins in women and may aid in the development of nicotine replacement products for smoking cessation. This review examines the present state of knowledge concerning the effects of nicotine on the female endocrine system. The first part of this article briefly summarizes recent findings from studies on nicotine metabolism. The second and third parts provide an overview of nicotine effects on hormone levels and the functional consequences of these effects in non-pregnant and pregnant women. In the final part, the influence of hormonal factors and pregnancy on metabolism and the pharmacological effects of nicotine are discussed.</AbstractText>
