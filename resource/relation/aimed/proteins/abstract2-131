<AbstractText>Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis requires the correct assembly of kinetochores--complexes of centromeric DNA and proteins that link chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Studies on the kinetochore of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed functionally novel components of the kinetochore and its regulatory complexes, some of which are highly conserved in humans.</AbstractText>
