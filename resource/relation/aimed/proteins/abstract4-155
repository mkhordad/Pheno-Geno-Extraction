<AbstractText>Systems for the staging of individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection were developed 15 years ago. Subsequently, assays for quantitating HIV-1 RNA and immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets have been developed and validated. The utility of these assays for improved staging in early disease was evaluated in 256 HIV-infected adults (52% minority) with <prot>CD4</prot> counts  or = 400 cells/microL followed in U.S. military medical centers before the highly active anti-retroviral therapy era. HIV viral load (RNA) was quantitated; the frequencies of select <prot>CD4</prot>+ immunophenotypes were determined in 112 subjects. The results were analyzed in relation to three outcome measures: death, first acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infection, and <prot>CD4</prot> count &#60; or = 200 cells/microL. Serum RNA level and <prot>CD4</prot> count were each found to be predictive of all three outcomes. In addition, increases in the T-cell subsets <prot>CD28</prot>-<prot>CD4</prot>+ and <prot>CD29</prot>+<prot>CD26</prot>-<prot>CD4</prot>+ were found to be independently predictive of more rapid progression. The classification of early-stage HIV patients is improved by the quantitation of both viral RNA and T-lymphocyte subsets.</AbstractText>
