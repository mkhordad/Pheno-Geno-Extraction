<AbstractText>BACKGROUND: <prot>Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase</prot> (<prot>MMCE</prot>) is an essential enzyme in the breakdown of odd-numbered fatty acids and of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, and methionine. Present in many bacteria and in animals, it catalyzes the conversion of (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, the substrate for the B12-dependent enzyme, <prot>methylmalonyl-CoA mutase</prot>. Defects in this pathway can result in severe acidosis and cause damage to the central nervous system in humans. RESULTS: The crystal structure of <prot>MMCE</prot> from Propionibacterium shermanii has been determined at 2.0 A resolution. The <prot>MMCE</prot> monomer is folded into two tandem betaalphabetabetabeta modules that pack edge-to-edge to generate an 8-stranded beta sheet. Two monomers then pack back-to-back to create a tightly associated dimer. In each monomer, the beta sheet curves around to create a deep cleft, in the floor of which <prot>His12</prot>, <prot>Gln65</prot>, <prot>His91</prot>, and <prot>Glu141</prot> provide a binding site for a divalent metal ion, as shown by the binding of Co2+. Modeling 2-methylmalonate into the active site identifies two glutamate residues as the likely essential bases for the epimerization reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The betaalphabetabetabeta modules of <prot>MMCE</prot> correspond with those found in several other proteins, including <prot>bleomycin resistance protein</prot>, <prot>glyoxalase I</prot>, and a family of extradiol dioxygenases. Differences in connectivity are consistent with the evolution of these very different proteins from a common precursor by mechanisms of gene duplication and domain swapping. The metal binding residues also align precisely, and striking structural similarities between <prot>MMCE</prot> and <prot>glyoxalase I</prot> suggest common mechanisms in their respective epimerization and isomerization reactions.</AbstractText>
