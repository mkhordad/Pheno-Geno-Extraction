<AbstractText>OBJECTIVE: To investigate follicle growth in fresh and cryopreserved human ovarian cortical grafts transplanted to immunodeficient mice. STUDY DESIGN: Fresh or frozen-thawed human ovarian cortex was grafted subcutaneously or under the kidney capsule of 43 mice (35 nude mice and eight SCID mice), 14 of which were non-stimulated controls, 21 injected intra-peritoneally with gonadotrophins during 2 weeks and eight injected during 3 months. Follicle count was compared by Chi-square. RESULTS: Proportions of primordial follicles were significantly lower in grafts than in the tissue before transplantation in gonadotrophin-stimulated mice (37% versus 79%), but not in non-stimulated mice (51% versus 74%). Proportions of primary and secondary follicles were increased after transplantation indicating early follicular growth. One antral follicle was observed in a graft in a mouse stimulated for 3 months. CONCLUSION: Primordial follicles in fresh or frozen-thawed human ovarian cortex transplanted under the kidney capsule or subcutaneously can grow and are responsive to hormonal stimulation. Condensation: Primordial follicles in fresh and cryopreserved human ovarian cortical grafts can initiate growth after transplantation to immunodeficient mice</AbstractText>
