<AbstractText>Helper-dependent minimal adenovirus vectors are promising tools for gene transfer and therapy because of their high capacity and the absence of immunostimulatory or cytotoxic viral genes. In order to characterize this new vector system with respect to its integrative properties, the integration pattern of a minimal adenovirus vector with a <prot>neo(r)</prot> gene inserted centrally into a noncoding 27.4-kb genomic stuffer element derived from the human X chromosome after infection of a sex chromosome aneuploid (X0) human glioblastoma cell line was studied. Our results indicate that even extensive homologies and abundant chromosomal repeat elements present in the vector did not lead to integration of the vector via homologous or homology-mediated mechanisms. Instead, integration occurred primarily by insertion of a monomer with no or little loss of sequences at the vector ends, apparently at random sites, which is very similar to <prot>E1</prot> deletion adenovirus vectors. It is therefore unlikely that the incorporation of stuffer elements derived from human genomic DNA, which were shown to allow long-term transgene expression in vivo in a number of studies, leads to an enhanced risk of insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the potential of minimal adenovirus vectors as tools for targeted insertion and gene targeting is limited despite the possibility of incorporating long stretches of homologous sequences. However, we found an enhanced efficiency of stable <prot>neo(r)</prot> transduction of the minimal adenovirus vector compared to an <prot>E1</prot> deletion adenovirus vector, possibly caused by the absence of potential growth-inhibitory viral genes. Complete integration of the vector and tolerance of the integrated vector sequences by the cell might indicate a potential use of these vectors as tools for stable transfer of (large) genes.</AbstractText>
