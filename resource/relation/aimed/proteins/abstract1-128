<AbstractText>The non-isotopic assay (NIRCA), based on the observation that RNAse is able to specifically cleave a single mismatch in RNA/RNA duplexes, has been recently proposed to detect <prot>p53</prot> mutations. To verify the use of this method as a valid screening for <prot>P53</prot> mutations in a routinely collected cancer series, we used this assay on 3 cases with normal and 5 cases with abnormal <prot>P53</prot> expression detected by Western blots. In all cases, <prot>P53</prot> exons 5-6, 7 and 8-9 regions were analyzed. There were mutations only in the five overexpressed cases: two cases showed mutations in exon 5, one between intron 6 and exon 6 and two in the region spanning exons 8 and 9. Our experience showed NIRCA to be fast, reliable and providing the ability to study long target regions in a single step, thus making this assay useful for genetic screenings.</AbstractText>
