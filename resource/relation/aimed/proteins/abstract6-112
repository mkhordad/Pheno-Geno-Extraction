<AbstractText>Characterisation of chromosome rearrangements using conventional banding techniques often fails to determine the localisation of breakpoints precisely. In order to improve the definition of chromosomal breakpoints, the high-resolution multicolour banding (MCB) technique was applied to identify human chromosome 5 breakpoints from 40 clinical cases previously assessed by conventional banding techniques. In 30 cases (75%), at least one breakpoint was redefined, indicating that MCB markedly improves chromosomal breakpoint localisation. The MCB pattern is highly reproducible and, in contrast to conventional banding pattern, is consistent in both short and elongated chromosomes. This might be of fundamental interest for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities, especially in tumour cells. Moreover, MCB even allows the detection of abnormalities that remain cryptic in GTG-banding analysis.</AbstractText>
