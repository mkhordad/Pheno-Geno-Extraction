<AbstractText>The antioxidant activity of melatonin (MEL) has been considered to constitute part of its physiological as well as pharmacological effects. However, as described herein we found a profound prooxidant activity of micro- to millimolar concentrations of MEL in the human leukemic Jurkat cell line. This prooxidant effect was increased in glutathione-depleted cells and counteracted by antioxidants. As a consequence MEL promoted <prot>fas</prot>-induced cell death. These data therefore indicate that MEL may be a modulator of the cellular redox status, but does not necessarily act as an intracellular antioxidant.</AbstractText>
