<AbstractText>Women now constitute 28% of new cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Cervical cancer in HIV-infected women has a high recurrence and death rate, as well as decreased intervals to recurrence and death. Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix are characterized by a high frequency of early nodal and distant metastases. We present the first report of a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix in an HIV-positive patient. A 28 year old with a 9-year history of HIV succumbed to metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix 5 months after diagnosis. Given the aggressive nature of the cell type, an extended metastatic workup should be considered prior to surgery. The immune suppression present in HIV-positive patients with neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma may make such a workup particularly crucial, such that surgery is offered only to those who can be expected to benefit.</AbstractText>
