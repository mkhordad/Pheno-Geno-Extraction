<AbstractText>Intrauterine infection of the fetus is clearly an important mode of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The syncytiotrophoblast layer of the human placenta must be traversed by HIV-1 in order to reach underlying cells and fetal capillaries. Although HIV-1 has been detected in the syncytiotrophoblast layer in situ, there is conflicting evidence regarding infection of syncytiotrophoblast cells with cell-free virus. The phenotypic mixing between HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been exploited to assay the susceptibility of human term syncytiotrophoblast cells to penetration by various strains of HIV-1. VSV(HIV-1(IIIB)) and VSV(HIV-1(Ba-L)) pseudotypes were found to enter syncytiotrophoblast cells. In contrast, VSV pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins of RF, MN, or Ada-M strains of HIV-1 did not infect syncytiotrophoblasts. Plating efficiency of VSV(HIV-1(IIIB)) and VSV(HIV-1(Ba-L)) was 10-fold lower on syncytiotrophoblasts than on T-cells and macrophages, respectively. Incubation of VSV(HIV-1(IIIB)) and VSV(HIV-1(Ba-L)) viruses with appropriate HIV-1 neutralizing sera before infection strongly inhibited entry of pseudotyped VSV into syncytiotrophoblast cells. These findings demonstrated that infection of syncytiotrophoblasts with VSV(HIV-1) pseudotypes was mediated by <prot>Env</prot> from IIIB and Ba-L strains of HIV-1. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to <prot>CD4</prot>, <prot>CXCR4</prot>, <prot>CCR5</prot>, and <prot>CCR3</prot> were tested for their ability to block VSV(HIV-1) infection of syncytiotrophoblast cells. Neither the anti-<prot>CD4</prot> nor the anti-<prot>CXCR4</prot>, anti-<prot>CCR5</prot>, and anti-<prot>CCR3</prot> MAb had any inhibitory effect on infection of syncytiotrophoblast cells with VSV(HIV-1) pseudotypes. Results from this study suggest that cell-free HIV-1 can enter syncytiotrophoblasts and the susceptibility of these cells to penetration by the virus is strain dependent. Pseudotype infection merely demonstrates that the first steps in HIV-1 replication are possible in syncytiotrophoblast cells.</AbstractText>
