<AbstractText>Astronauts lose body mass when exploring space. The mechanism was considered to be an upward fluid shift inducing diuresis and natriuresis (the Henry-Gauer mechanism) during the first few days in microgravity. However, recent space missions have shown that neither diuresis nor natriuresis occurs in space missions. In contrast, a sodium-retaining status was shown, which led to positive metabolic sodium balances without fluid retention. Energy intake was consistently reduced whereas energy needs were unchanged, resulting in a negative energy balance of 20%. The reasons for this are many, although proper studies on appetite regulation have not been carried out. Despite numerous countermeasures, bone mass is lost in microgravity situations. These are body composition changes that need to be challenged before humans can be sent to space for extra-long missions.</AbstractText>
