<AbstractText>We have developed a sensitive, economical method that directly detects viruses by making use of the interaction between type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and specific antibodies covalently attached to the oscillating surface of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The virions were detached from the surface by monotonously increasing the amplitude of oscillation of the QCM, while using the QCM to sensitively detect the acoustic noise produced when the interactions were broken. We term this process rupture event scanning (REVS). The method is quantitative over at least six orders of magnitude, and its sensitivity approaches detection of a single virus particle.</AbstractText>
