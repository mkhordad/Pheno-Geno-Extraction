<AbstractText>Self-efficacy has become an important variable in multiple areas of human performance, including health behavior modification (Bandura, 1997). This study explores variables that lead to women's perceived self-efficacy in performing regular detection practices for breast and cervical cancer. A sample of southeastern U.S. farm women (N = 206) completed surveys that assessed their perceived and actual knowledge of women's cancer detection practices, as well as their perceived social norms and perceived barriers related to obtaining these tests. Regression analyses of these data revealed that perceived peer norms and the barriers of time and embarrassment were significant predictors of women's confidence in their ability to follow through with cancer detection practices. Perceived knowledge and perceived family norms significantly predicted women's perceptions of difficulty associated with cancer detection practices as well as women's confidence in their skills to perform breast self-examination (BSE). Time was also a significant barrier to confidence in performing BSE. Implications for health communication campaigns are discussed.</AbstractText>
