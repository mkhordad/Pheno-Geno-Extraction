<ArticleTitle>Upregulation of the gene encoding a cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain in senescent human cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Normal human somatic cells, unlike cancer cells, stop dividing after a limited number of cell divisions through the process termed cellular senescence or replicative senescence, which functions as a tumor-suppressive mechanism and may be related to organismal aging. By means of the cDNA subtractive hybridization, we identified eight genes upregulated during normal chromosome 3-induced cellular senescence in a human renal cell carcinoma cell line. Among them is the <prot>DNCI1</prot> gene encoding an intermediate chain 1 of the cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule motor that plays a role in chromosome movement and organelle transport. The <prot>DNCI1</prot> mRNA was also upregulated during in vitro aging of primary human fibroblasts. In contrast, other components of cytoplasmic dynein showed no significant change in mRNA expression during cellular aging. Cell growth arrest by serum starvation, contact inhibition, or gamma-irradiation did not induce the <prot>DNCI1</prot> mRNA, suggesting its specific role in cellular senescence. The <prot>DNCI1</prot> gene is on the long arm of chromosome 7 where tumor suppressor genes and a senescence-inducing gene for a group of immortal cell lines (complementation group D) are mapped. This is the first report that links a component of molecular motor complex to cellular senescence, providing a new insight into molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence.</AbstractText>
