<AbstractText>Everyday, people flexibly perform different categorizations of common faces, objects and scenes. Intuition and scattered evidence suggest that these categorizations require the use of different visual information from the input. However, there is no unifying method, based on the categorization performance of subjects, that can isolate the information used. To this end, we developed Bubbles, a general technique that can assign the credit of human categorization performance to specific visual information. To illustrate the technique, we applied Bubbles on three categorization tasks (gender, expressive or not and identity) on the same set of faces, with human and ideal observers to compare the features they used.</AbstractText>
