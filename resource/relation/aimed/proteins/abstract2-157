<AbstractText>The aim of this article was to investigate septal branches of the right coronary artery in order to create both their typologies and to evaluate the usefulness of the vessels mentioned above for revascularisation procedures on the interventricular heart septum. The clinical studies were performed on 58 human hearts aged 28-80. Technical method of direct preparation, corrosive preparation and coronarographic picture assessment. The tests showed that the number of septal branches ranged from 5 to 11, their diameter from 0.7 to 1.2 mm. There were no main trunk or vessels with different dimensions than other arteries. Creation of septal vascularisation model was not possible because of rapid changes in studied vessels, their distribution and small diameters (about 1 mm) disqualifying them for direct revascularised operations on interventricular heart septum.</AbstractText>
