<AbstractText>Genotyping of human platelet antigens (HPAs) can be useful for the diagnosis and therapy of alloimmune thrombocytopenic syndromes such as neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura and refractoriness to platelet transfusion therapy. We developed a single-tube method for <prot>HPA-5</prot> genotyping on the LightCycler that combines rapid-cycle polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting for mutation detection. Our method is fast, robust and suitable for routine <prot>HPA-5</prot> typing. This work extends recent studies on <prot>HPA-1</prot> typing using the LightCycler.</AbstractText>
