<AbstractText>Merkel cells are thought to function as slowly adapting mechanoreceptors and are known as targets for sensory nerves. However, the nerve-dependency of Merkel cells remains controversial. In this respect, some investigators have found interregional differences between hairy and glabrous skin and others have shown intraregional differences within denervated rat touch domes. Differences between species have also been reported. This study was performed to determine whether Merkel cells proliferate in vitro in the absence of the systemic factors, blood vessels and the intact nerves in human skin. Suspension organ culture was performed using fetal digits to investigate their in vitro proliferation. Merkel cells and cutaneous nerves were identified using antibodies to cytokeratin 20 and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), respectively. Fetal digits of 56-82 day gestational age were cultured in serum free medium in a high O2 (45%) environment. Tissues were harvested before starting culture (D0) and 1, 4, 7, 14, 28 d after culture. Merkel cells were observed in the volar pads and dorsal nail matrices at D0. After 28 d of suspension organ culture, digits looked healthy structurally and the number of Merkel cells had increased. However, PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerves were markedly diminished after 1 day of culture and almost disappeared after 4 days. Merkel cell proliferation in vitro suggested that Merkel cell development is probably nerve-independent in human fetal glabrous skin.</AbstractText>
