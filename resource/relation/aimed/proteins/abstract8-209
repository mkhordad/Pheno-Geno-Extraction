<AbstractText>The initial sequencing of the human genome should be regarded as a milestone in a road that stretches years into the future; the full ramifications of the Human Genome Project are still only being theorized. Researchers will benefit from the catalog of human genes in studies of the genetics of disease susceptibility and the cell biology of gene interactions. Clinicians will increasingly offer genetic or biochemical testing to identify those at highest risk for a number of diseases. Drug discovery will eventually follow newly possible studies of gene expression and protein function. However the Human Genome Project eventually shapes medicine, it is certain that physicians, particularly obstetricians and gynecologists, will need to be well versed in the scientific and ethical issues involved, inasmuch as we will likely be at the center of the most heated debates.</AbstractText>
