<AbstractText>BACKGROUND: Grass pollen extracts currently used for allergy diagnosis and immunotherapy are a complex mixture of proteins of which only a few have allergenic activity. <prot>Lol p 1</prot> is one of the most important allergens in grass pollen extracts. OBJECTIVES: To develop a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantification of <prot>Lol p 1</prot> and other group 1 allergens from grass species, and to assess its suitability for quantifying this group of allergens. METHODS: Balb/c mice immunized with recombinant <prot>Lol p 1</prot> were used for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Screening of hybridomas was performed by direct ELISA, and selected monoclonal antibodies were immobilized on ELISA plates and incubated with samples containing group 1 allergens. Bound allergens were detected by a combination of biotinylated <prot>Lol p 1</prot>-specific monoclonal antibody and <prot>peroxidase</prot>-<prot>streptavidin</prot> conjugate. RESULTS: The assay is based on three <prot>Lol p 1</prot>-specific monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities. The optimized ELISA measured <prot>Lol p 1</prot> concentrations ranging from 125 to 1000 ng/mL and could quantify group 1 allergen from grass species belonging to the Pooidea subfamily. The assay does not depend on anti-sera production or availability of human sera and thus reactives can be produced in unlimited amounts. CONCLUSION: This sensitive and specific <prot>Lol p 1</prot> assay will be helpful both for quantifying the group 1 allergen content of Pooideae pollen extracts intended for clinical use and for studying cross-reactivities among pollen extracts.</AbstractText>
