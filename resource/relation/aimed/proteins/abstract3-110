<AbstractText>Platelet factor-4 is a protein belonging to the family of ELR-negative CXC chemokines which binds to fibroblast growth factor and inhibits its mitogenic activity. Platelet factor-4 also inhibits tumor growth by mechanisms involving antiangiogenesis. Antiangiogenic activity in vitro has also been shown for the 24-residue C-terminal fragment of the protein, which decreases the affinity between basic fibroblast growth factor and its cell-surface receptor. In this study, the preferential conformation of this fragment in solution has been determined and has been found to be composed of two helical subdomains. In addition, we show that the fragment forms a specific 1:1 complex with acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and that both subdomains are probably required for inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-driven mitogenesis. Finally, we show that the binding of the fragment alters the structure of the fibroblast growth factors, although some of such alterations do not seem related with the inhibition of mitogenic activity. Since this fragment has recently been shown to inhibit fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vivo when injected intraperitoneally, these results are relevant for developing new antiangiogenic treatments.</AbstractText>
