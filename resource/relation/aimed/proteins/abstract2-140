<AbstractText>During the last 30 years, new epidemiological patterns have emerged as free-ranging wildlife have become progressively more involved in the epidemiology of both common and emerging infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals. This has been seen in rabies, bovine tuberculosis and more recently in wild-boar classical swine fever. Emerging diseases are of interest to veterinarians as well as public health officials but attempts to control these diseases have not always been successful as in wildlife populations control of either host or pathogen can present particular problems. Lessons should be learnt from previous experiences to help in the management of new emerging diseases in the future.</AbstractText>
