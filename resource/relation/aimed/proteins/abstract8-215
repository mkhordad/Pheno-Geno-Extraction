<ArticleTitle>An abundance of bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases--implications for the origin of exotoxins and their human homologues.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that can be seen in many contexts, including as the primary mechanism of action of many important bacterial exotoxins. By data-mining complete and incomplete bacterial genome sequences, we have discovered 20 novel putative ADP-ribosyltransferases, including several new potential toxins.</AbstractText>
