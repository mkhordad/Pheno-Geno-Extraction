<AbstractText>Maternal serum human <prot>thyroid-stimulating hormone</prot> (<prot>TSH</prot>) levels were investigated in chromosomally normal and Down syndrome pregnancies to determine whether <prot>TSH</prot> can be used as a marker for Down syndrome in the first trimester. Measurements were conducted on stored serum samples collected from 23 Down syndrome pregnancies and 115 unaffected pregnancies before chorionic villus sampling (CVS), between 9 and 11 completed weeks of pregnancy. The samples were matched for gestational age, maternal age, maternal weight and duration of storage of the serum sample. Maternal <prot>TSH</prot> concentration was slightly decreased in Down syndrome pregnancies, with a median of 0.84 multiples of the median (MoM). Maternal serum human <prot>chorionic gonadotropin</prot> (<prot>hCG</prot>) concentration was slightly elevated in Down syndrome pregnancies, with a median of 1.03 MoM. Both differences were not significant applying matched rank analysis (p=0.50 for <prot>TSH</prot> and p=0.43 for <prot>hCG</prot>). The association between <prot>TSH</prot> and hCG in unaffected pregnancies was also measured. The Spearman correlation coefficient between <prot>TSH</prot> and <prot>hCG</prot> was -0.21 which was statistically significant (p=0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.38 to -0.03). However, it was concluded that <prot>TSH</prot> is not a useful marker for distinguishing Down syndrome-affected pregnancies from normal pregnancies in the first trimester.</AbstractText>
