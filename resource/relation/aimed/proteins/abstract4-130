<AbstractText>Clinical investigation in humans and experimental lentivirus infection in nonhuman primates have advanced our understanding of immune responses that control HIV-1 disease. Recently, immunization approaches in macaques have shown that the immune response can control viremia and improve clinical outcome. When such vaccine strategies are formulated to be similarly immunogenic in humans, they could form the basis for the development of candidate AIDS vaccines that would prevent infection, suppress progression to disease or reduce HIV-1 transmission in humans.</AbstractText>
