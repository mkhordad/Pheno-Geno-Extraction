<AbstractText>Lead contamination of water is a major health hazard, as illustrated by the fact that exposure to this metal has been associated with death and disease in humans, birds, and animals. The present research was aimed at the development of a porous, solid-phase sorbent that can be used in the remediation of lead-contaminated water. A suitable sorbent was identified by screening various clays and other materials for their ability to effectively bind lead. The clay was adhered to a solid support using an aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose. The binary composite was then tested for its ability to bind lead from solution, while providing void volume, increased surface area, and considerably enhanced hydraulic conductivity. The results suggested that a combination of sodium montmorillonite clay and carbon exhibited enhanced sorption of lead compared to carbon alone, and also supported the potential application of various combinations of sorbent materials. This value-added combination of clay, solid support, and adhesive will allow for the construction of column filtration systems that are multifunctional and capable of purifying large volumes of contaminated water.</AbstractText>
