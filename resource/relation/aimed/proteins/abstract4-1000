<AbstractText>Positive selection of immature thymocytes is a developmental process in which TCR ligation with low avidity induces generation of mature T cells. In mouse thymocytes, <prot>CD4</prot>(+)8(+) double-positive (DP) cells which were treated with a proper combination of calcium ionophore ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) have been reported to differentiate into <prot>CD4</prot> single positive cells. However, in human thymocytes the effects of PMA and ionomycin have remained unclear. Here we report that DP cells that were treated with PMA and ionomycin up-regulated <prot>bcl-2</prot> and down-regulated <prot>CD1</prot> expression. However, <prot>CD3</prot> expression remained low. This treatment induced prolonged <prot>CD4</prot> down-regulation in DP cells which was an effect also seen in mature peripheral blood T cells. PMA/ionomycin-treated DP cells showed high cell proliferation and resistance to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that PKC activation and calcium elevation may be part of the biochemical signals that induce positive selection of human DP cells and the system described in this paper may be a useful model to study the signals involved in the selection of human thymocytes.</AbstractText>
