<AbstractText>The herbicides 6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (atrazine) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) are widely used in agricultural practice to fight dicotyledon weeds mainly in maize, cereals, and lucerne. As a result, these compounds are found not only in the plants, soil, and water, but also in the cultivated ground in the following years as well as in agricultural products such as fruits, milk, butter, and sugar beet. The toxicological effects of herbicides occur in vivo, when transported to the target organ through the bloodstream. It has been suggested that human <prot>serum albumin</prot> (<prot>HSA</prot>) serves as a carrier protein to transport 2,4-D to molecular targets. This study was designed to examine the interaction of atrazine and 2,4-D with <prot>HSA</prot> in aqueous solution at physiological pH with herbicide concentrations of 0.0001-1 mM, and final protein concentration of 1% w/v. Gel and capillary electrophoresis, UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic methods were used to determine the drug binding mode, the drug binding constant, and the protein secondary structure in aqueous solution. Structural analysis showed that different types of herbicide-<prot>HSA</prot> complexes are formed with stoichiometric ratios (drug/protein) of 3:1 and 11:1 for atrazine and 4.5:1 and 10:1 for 2,4-D complexes. Atrazine showed a weak binding affinity (K=3.50 x 10(4) M(-1)), whereas two bindings (K(1)=2.50 x 10(4) M(-1) and K(2)=8.0 x 10(3) M(-1)) were observed for 2,4-D complexes. The herbicide binding results in major protein secondary structural changes from that of the alpha-helix 55% to 45--39% and beta-sheet 22% to 24--32%, beta-anti 12% to 10--22% and turn 11% to 12--15%, in the drug-<prot>HSA</prot> complexes. The observed spectral changes indicate a partial unfolding of the protein structure, in the presence of herbicides in aqueous solution.</AbstractText>
