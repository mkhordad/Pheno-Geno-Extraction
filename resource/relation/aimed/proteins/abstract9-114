<AbstractText>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a bile acid (BA) used for cholesterol gallstone dissolution. Since epidemiological evidence indicates that BAs can be involved in the etiology of colorectal cancer, we investigated the effects of UDCA and its physiologically produced taurine conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on human lymphocyte cultures in terms of genetic damage in the form of micronuclei (MN) production, cell cycle modifications and induction of apoptosis. With respect to controls, treatment with UDCA (from 10 microg/ml) caused a dose-related increase in MN, whereas TUDCA caused no significant increase (up to 1000 microg/ml). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using pancentromeric probes suggested that UDCA exerts aneugenic activity. Bromodeoxyuridine/Hoechst flow cytometry showed that both BA significantly inhibit cell cycle progression (UDCA at 100 microg/ml, and TUDCA, more markedly at 300-1000 microg/ml). Neither UDCA nor TUDCA affected induction of apoptosis, as evaluated by the <prot>Annexin-V</prot>-Fluos assay. We conclude that UDCA is potentially genotoxic. However, taking into account the characteristics of other physiological BA, our findings are in line with the concept that long-term UDCA treatment may be safely administered. The multi-assay approach reported here could be useful in the toxicological evaluation of newly developed BA analogs as candidates for pharmacological use.</AbstractText>
