<AbstractText>We examined the expression profile of chemokine receptors in human basophils and their regulation by cytokines. Basophils expressed transcripts of <prot>CC chemokine receptors (CCR)1</prot>, <prot>CCR2</prot>, <prot>CCR3</prot>, and <prot>CCR5</prot> and <prot>CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR)1</prot>, <prot>CXCR2</prot>, and <prot>CXCR4</prot>. In contrast to the other receptors, surface-<prot>CXCR4</prot> expression was not detected in fresh- and whole-blood basophils, but it became apparent gradually during incubation. Among 16 chemokines tested, <prot>eotaxin</prot> induced the most potent basophil migration. <prot>SDF-1</prot> also induced a strong, migratory response comparable with that induced by <prot>eotaxin</prot> in 24-h, cultured basophils, but it failed to induce degranulation. <prot>IL-3</prot> abrogated <prot>CXCR4</prot> expression completely, and it only down-regulated <prot>CCR2</prot> and <prot>CCR3</prot> expression slightly. <prot>IL-5</prot>, <prot>GM-CSF</prot>, and <prot>IL-4</prot> also down-regulated <prot>CXCR4</prot> expression. Thus, expression of <prot>CXCR4</prot> was the most strongly affected by cytokines, and this may represent an alternative mechanism for control of cell-specific, biological responses to <prot>SDF-1</prot>.</AbstractText>
