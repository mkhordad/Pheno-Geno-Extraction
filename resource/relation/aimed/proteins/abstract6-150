<AbstractText>OBJECTIVE: To characterize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human synovial membrane (SM). METHODS: Cell populations were enzymatically released from the SM obtained from knee joints of adult human donors and were expanded in monolayer with serial passages at confluence. Cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. At different passages, SM-derived cells were subjected to in vitro assays to investigate their multilineage potential. Upon treatments, phenotypes of cell cultures were analyzed by histo- and immunohistochemistry and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the expression of lineage-retated marker genes. RESULTS: SM-derived cells could be expanded extensively in monolayer, with limited senescence. Under appropriate culture conditions, SM-derived cells were induced to differentiate to the chondrocyte, osteocyte, and adipocyte lineages. Sporadic myogenesis was also observed. Five independent cell clones displayed multilineage potential. Interestingly, only 1 clone was myogenic. Donor age, cell passaging, and cryopreservation did not affect the multilineage potential of SM-derived cells. In contrast, normal dermal fibroblasts under the same culture conditions did not display this potential. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that human multipotent MSCs can be isolated from the SM of knee joints. These cells have the ability to proliferate extensively in culture, and they maintain their multilineage differentiation potential in vitro, establishing their progenitor cell nature. SM-derived MSCs may play a role in the regenerative response during arthritic diseases and are promising candidates for developing novel cell-based therapeutic approaches for postnatal skeletal tissue repair.</AbstractText>
