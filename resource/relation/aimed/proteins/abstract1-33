<AbstractText>The content of body iron is regulated primarily by absorption since humans have no physiological mechanism by which excess iron is excreted. This regulation, however, is not absolute. Many factors such as the content of diets, iron doses, life styles, etc. influence iron absorption. In the past, nutrition programs for iron fortification and the ingestion of iron preparations have been widely practiced because of the seriousness of worldwide iron deficiency. Also, we now know that a significant number of asymptomatic people carry the hemochromatosis gene, HFE, indicating that these people have the potential to accumulate excess body iron in their lifetime. Excess body iron can be highly toxic. This toxicity involves many organs leading to a variety of serious diseases such as liver disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hormonal abnormalities, dysfunctional immune system, etc. The tissue damage associated with iron overload is believed to result primarily from free radical reactions mediated by iron. Iron is an effective catalyst in free radical reactions. The diseases associated with iron overload can be managed effectively or prevented. Therefore, early diagnosis of iron overload and appropriate therapy are critical. By providing the necessary laboratory data, clinical chemistry laboratories can play the pivotal role in the management of these health problems.</AbstractText>
