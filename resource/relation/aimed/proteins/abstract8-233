<AbstractText>Argus simulates a radar-like target classification task. It was developed to support research in measuring and modeling cognitive work load. Argus is used in both single-subject and team modes. However, the Argus system is more than just a simulated task environment. Argus features flexible experimenter control over cognitive work load, as well as extensive data collection and data playback facilities to support the iterative nature of research in complex behaviors. In addition, embodied computational models interact with Argus using the same interface as do human subjects. In this paper, we describe these features, as well as the task simulation. In addition, we describe how the system has been used for experimentation. We conclude with a comparison of Argus with other complex task environments.</AbstractText>
