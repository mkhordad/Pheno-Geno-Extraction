<AbstractText>The reactive oxygen species are known as endogenous toxic oxidant damaging factors in a variety of cell types, and in response, the antioxidant genes have been implicated in cell proliferation, senescence, immortalization, and tumorigenesis. The expression of <prot>manganese superoxide dismutase</prot> mRNA was shown to increase in most of the immortal chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells tested, while expression of <prot>catalase</prot> mRNA appeared to be dramatically decreased in all immortal CEF cells compared to their primary counterparts. The expression of <prot>copper-zinc superoxide dismutase</prot> mRNA was shown to increase slightly in some immortal CEF cells. The <prot>glutathione peroxidase</prot> expressed relatively similar levels in both primary and immortal CEF cells. As primary and immortal DF-1 CEF cells were treated with 10-100 microM of hydrogen peroxide (concentrations known to be sublethal in human diploid fibroblasts), immortal DF-1 CEF cells were shown to be more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, and total cell numbers were dramatically reduced when compared with primary cell counterparts. This increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in immortal DF-1 cells occurred without evident changes in either antioxidant gene expression, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle distribution or chromatin condensation. However, the total number of dead cells without chromatin condensation was dramatically elevated in immortal DF-1 CEFs treated with hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the inhibition of immortal DF-1 cell growth by low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is due to increased necrotic cell death, but not apoptosis. Taken together, our observation suggests that the balanced antioxidant function might be important for cell proliferation in response to toxic oxidative damage by hydrogen peroxide.</AbstractText>
