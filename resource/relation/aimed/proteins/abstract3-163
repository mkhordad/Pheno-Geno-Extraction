<AbstractText>Increased intracranial pressure in patients with acute liver failure remains a major cause of mortality. Treatment options are limited, and without urgent liver transplantation, mortality rates of up to 90% are common in those who fulfill criteria for poor prognosis. Several studies in animal models of acute liver failure set the stage for the clinical application of moderate hypothermia in humans. Few patients are treated with hypothermia for increased intracranial pressure. However, data indicate that moderate hypothermia is a safe and effective method of treatment for increased intracranial pressure that is unresponsive to other medical therapies, and that this treatment can be used as a successful bridge to liver transplantation. Recent data also suggest that increases in intracranial pressure can be prevented during the dissection and reperfusion phases of liver transplantation for acute liver failure if patients are kept hypothermic during the surgical procedure. This article focuses on the use of moderate hypothermia for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in patients with acute liver failure.</AbstractText>
