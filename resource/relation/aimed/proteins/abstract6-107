<AbstractText>The group B streptococci (GBS) are one of the main infections' factors in neonates. The source of the infection is mother and the infection follows during childbirth. In many countries various methods of prophylaxis in reference to mother and neonate are introduced. Thus far the widest application have found a method of giving to pregnant women penicillins or cephalosporins. The purpose of the present work was to study how the drug-resistant of the GBS forms in our country and if using antibiotics in prophylactic purposes without doing any antibiograms is burdened with risk, resulted from the possibility of meeting resistant strains. 365 strains of the GBS, derived from colonised neonates, pregnant women and clinical materials were put to the scientific research. 120 animal strains isolated from events of mastitis in cows, represented the second group. The GBS, derived from pregnant women were sensitive to every examined antibiotics except lincomycin (5.9%). Amid the streptococcus isolated from neonates there were some strains resistant to every examined antibiotic (1.9-4.4%). More often resistant strains were isolated from clinical materials (3.9-9.0%). The highest percentage of the resistant strains was identified in animals (7.5-20.0%). The GBS as a rule were insensitive to cotrimoxasolum. As follows from our scientific researches, the GBS derived from people as a rule are sensitive to used antibiotics. But there were some strains resistant even to several antibiotics. Possibility of meeting these strains should be taken into consideration as in prophylaxis as in treatment of the infections. Amid the animal strains of the GBS the phenomenon of the resistance to antibiotics is more often met than in human ones.</AbstractText>
