<AbstractText>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has seven genotypes, A to G. Previous studies have shown that genotype C is the most prevalent strain in chronic HBV carriers in East Asia. This study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of HBV genotypes among Japanese patients who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The sequences of the complete <prot>hepatitis B surface antigen</prot> (<prot>HBsAg</prot>) genes were obtained from 18 coinfected Japanese patients. Among the 18 patients, 12 of 13 men who had sex with men (MSM) had genotype A (92%), whereas only one of five heterosexual or hemophiliac patients had genotype A. The predominance of genotype A HBV in MSM showed a striking contrast to the current genotype prevalence in the Japanese population. Owing to the recent decrease in the rate of vertical transmission in Japan, the role of sexual behavior in the transmission of HBV cannot be overestimated. Thus, the relative proportion of genotype A may gradually increase in Japan.</AbstractText>
