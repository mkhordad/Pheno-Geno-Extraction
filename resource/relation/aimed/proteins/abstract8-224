<AbstractText>Mucormycosis is an infection caused by fungi in the Mucorales order, of which the most relevant family is Mucoraceae, which includes the Rhizopus, Mucor and Absidia genera. It is a severe infection which involves diabetic patients with ketoacidotic decompensation and immunosuppressed patients. We report here five cases (four with rhino-cerebral forms) attended at our hospital in the last ten years. Three patients had diabetes, one was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, and the other was on a programme of peritoneal dialysis due to renal failure. The most relevant clinical manifestation was the presence of the necrotic lesion in three of the four patients with rhinocerebral involvement (two in the palate, one in the nasal mucosa). Two patients died as a result of the direct infection a few days after diagnosis. In summary, mucormycosis is an infection with a low prevalence but still maintaining a high mortality rate. An early diagnosis is essential and thereby a high index of clinical suspicion is required in patients with predisposing factors.</AbstractText>
