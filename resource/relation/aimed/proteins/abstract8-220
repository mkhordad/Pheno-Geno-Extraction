<AbstractText>The aim of this paper is to clarify the distribution of <prot>Dopamine D1 (<prot>DA D1</prot>) receptor</prot>s in the uveo-scleral tissue of human eyes with or without elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and to study the relationships between <prot><prot>DA D1</prot> receptor</prot>s and uveo-scleral tissue. Samples of human uveo-scleral tissue were taken from seven men undergoing eye surgery for a traumatic lesion of the anterior segment of the eye, without involvement of the iris-corneal angle and /or from eye donors. The subjects (in whom one eye bulb had been surgically enucleated) had been previously enrolled in our medical protocols because they suffered for increased IOP, while the eye donors (of both eye bulbs) had a normal IOP. Frozen sections from the uveo-scleral tissue were submitted to biochemical characterization and to morphological autoradiographic techniques for detection of <prot><prot>DA-D1</prot> receptor</prot>s. [3H]-SCH-23390 was used as a ligand of <prot>Dopamine D1 receptor</prot>s. [3H]-SCH 23390 was bound by sections of the human uveo-scleral tissue. The pharmacological profile of the binding was consistent with the labeling of <prot>D1 receptor</prot>s. Light microscope analysis was used for localization of <prot>D1 receptor</prot>s and revealed an accumulation of the radioligand in the human uveo-scleral tissue. In eyes with normal IOP there is a high reaction. The Bmax of radioligand decreases in the eyes with increased IOP. The possibility that dopaminergic receptors play a role in the controlling uveo-scleral tissue functions is suggested.</AbstractText>
