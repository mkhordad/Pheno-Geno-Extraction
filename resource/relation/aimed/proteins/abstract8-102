<AbstractText>In a subset of papillary renal cell carcinomas a t(X;1)(p11;q21) chromosome translocation has repeatedly been reported. Positional cloning has demonstrated that, as a result of this translocation, the transcription factor <prot>TFE3</prot> gene on the X-chromosome becomes fused to a novel gene, <prot>PRCC</prot>, on chromosome 1. Since as yet little is known about the function of <prot>PRCC</prot>, we sought to identify the mouse counterpart of the <prot>PRCC</prot> gene. Isolation and sequence analysis of a mouse <prot>Prcc</prot> cDNA revealed a high level of conservation between man and mouse, both at the nucleotide and protein level. As the human <prot>PRCC</prot> gene, the mouse <prot>Prcc</prot> gene is ubiquitously expressed. It shows low expression in all mouse fetal tissues examined. In addition, we identified a genomic cosmid clone containing the complete <prot>Prcc</prot> gene. The mouse <prot>Prcc</prot> gene consists of seven exons, all of which contain coding sequences. The small second exon, which was found to be located adjacent to the t(X;1) breakpoint in the human gene on chromosome 1, is also conserved between man and mouse. In mouse, <prot>Prcc</prot> is located on chromosome 3. These cDNA and genomic clones will be instrumental in the creation of mouse models for a further elucidation of the function of <prot>PRCC</prot>.</AbstractText>
