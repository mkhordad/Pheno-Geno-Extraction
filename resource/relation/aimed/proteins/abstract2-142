<AbstractText>Both human and murine forms of <prot>nectin-1</prot> (<prot>HveC</prot>, <prot>Prr1</prot>) can serve as entry receptors for several neurotropic herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine herpesvirus 1. HSV-1, HSV-2, and PRV can cause lethal neurological disease in mice whether inoculation is directly into the central nervous system or by peripheral routes. Expression of <prot>nectin-1</prot> transcripts in cells of the adult mouse nervous system was assessed by in situ hybridization. Specific hybridization signals were detected in neurons in sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, specific signals were observed in neurons of the ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord and of the brain stem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and olfactory bulb. These results show that the <prot>nectin-1</prot> gene is widely transcribed in neurons in adult mouse. <prot>Nectin-1</prot> is the only known receptor capable of mediating the entry of all three viruses, HSV-1, HSV-2, and PRV. Its pattern of expression in the nervous system suggests a key role in neurological disease caused by these viruses.</AbstractText>
