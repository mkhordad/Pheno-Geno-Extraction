<ArticleTitle>The repertoire of Na,<prot>K-ATPase alpha</prot> and beta subunit genes expressed in the zebrafish, Danio rerio.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>We have identified a cohort of zebrafish expressed sequence tags encoding eight Na,<prot>K-ATPase alpha subunit</prot>s and five beta subunits. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis indicate that five of the zebrafish alpha subunit genes comprise an alpha1-like gene subfamily and two are orthologs of the mammalian alpha3 subunit gene. The remaining alpha subunit clone is most similar to the mammalian alpha2 subunit. Among the five beta subunit genes, two are orthologs of the mammalian beta1 isoform, one represents a beta2 ortholog, and two are orthologous to the mammalian beta3 subunit. Using zebrafish radiation hybrid and meiotic mapping panels, we determined linkage assignments for each alpha and beta subunit gene. Na,K-ATPase genes are dispersed in the zebrafish genome with the exception of four of the alpha1-like genes, which are tightly clustered on linkage group 1. Comparative mapping studies indicate that most of the zebrafish Na,K-ATPase genes localize to regions of conserved synteny between zebrafish and humans. The expression patterns of Na,<prot>K-ATPase alpha</prot> and beta subunit genes in zebrafish are quite distinctive. No two alpha or beta subunit genes exhibit the same expression profile. Together, our data imply a very high degree of Na,<prot>K-ATPase</prot> isoenzyme heterogeneity in zebrafish, with the potential for 40 structurally distinct alpha/beta subunit combinations. Differences in expression patterns of alpha and beta subunits suggest that many of the isoenzymes are also likely to exhibit differences in functional properties within specific cell and tissue types. Our studies form a framework for analyzing structure function relationships for sodium pump isoforms using reverse genetic approaches.</AbstractText>
