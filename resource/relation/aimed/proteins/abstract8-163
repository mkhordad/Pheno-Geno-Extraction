<AbstractText>OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the effect of <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot> activity on the ischemic and reoxygenated human myocardium. METHODS: Right atrial appendages (n = 6 per group) obtained during elective cardiac operations were sliced and stabilized in normoxic normothermic buffer solution for 30 minutes and then subjected to 90 minutes of simulated ischemia, followed by 120 minutes of reoxygenation. In study 1 the dose responses to the <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot> agonist phenylephrine (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 micromol/L) and to the <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot> antagonist prazosin (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 micromol/L) when administered for 10 minutes before ischemia, during ischemia, and during reoxygenation were examined. The influence of the time of administration (ie, before ischemia, during ischemia, or during reoxygenation) of phenylephrine (0.1 micromol/L) and prazosin (10 micromol/L) was then investigated in study 2. In study 3 the effect of the combined administration of phenylephrine given before ischemia and prazosin given during ischemia was investigated. In study 4 the protective effect of phenylephrine given before ischemia (for 10 minutes or for 5 minutes with a 5-minute washout period) was compared with that of ischemic preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reoxygenation). At the end of each protocol, the leakage of creatine kinase (in units per gram of wet weight) and the reduction of 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide to insoluble formazan dye (in millimoles per gram of wet weight) were measured. RESULTS: Phenylephrine is maximally beneficial at 0.1 and 1 micromol/L (<prot>creatinine kinase</prot>, 0.97 +/- 0.06 and 0.95 +/- 0.03 U/g, respectively; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 153.0 +/- 7.8 and 156.2 +/- 6.7 mmol/g, respectively) compared with ischemic control (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 1.87 +/- 0.03 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 108.5 +/- 6.8 mmol/g; P &#60;.05) but prazosin is detrimental at concentrations above 10 micromol/L (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 5.22 +/- 0.29 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 69.8 +/- 2.9 mmol/g; P &#60;.05 vs ischemic control). In addition, phenylephrine (0.1 micromol/L) is protective when given before ischemia (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 2.06 +/- 0.21 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 148.5 +/- 4.5 mmol/g; P &#60;.05 vs ischemic control) but is detrimental when given during ischemia alone (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 4.49 +/- 0.98 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 70.5 +/- 6.1 mmol/g; P &#60;.05 vs ischemic control) and has no significant effect during reoxygenation. In contrast, prazosin (10 micromol/L) is beneficial when given during ischemia alone (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 1.34 +/- 0.10 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 148.5 +/- 4.5 mmol/g; P &#60;.05 vs ischemic control), is detrimental when given during reoxygenation alone (<prot>creatine kinase</prot>, 1.5 +/- 0.16 U/g; 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 85.0 +/- 4.7 mmol/g; P &#60;.05 vs ischemic control), and has no effect when given before ischemia. The use of phenylephrine before ischemia alone is as protective as prazosin given during ischemia alone, but the combination of the two drugs does not cause additional benefit. Interestingly, the protection afforded by phenylephrine when given before ischemia is similar to that obtained with ischemic preconditioning. CONCLUSIONS: In the human myocardium activation of alpha1-adrenoceptors before ischemia is protective but is detrimental during ischemia, whereas blockade of <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot>s is beneficial during ischemia but detrimental during reoxygenation. The degree of protection achieved by activation of the <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot>s before ischemia is similar to that obtained with blockade of <prot>alpha1-adrenoceptor</prot>s during ischemia and that of ischemic preconditioning.</AbstractText>
