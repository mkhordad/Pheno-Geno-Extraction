<AbstractText>OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to analyse the relationship between apoptosis related proteins (<prot>bcl-2</prot> and <prot>bax</prot>), <prot>tumour suppressor protein p53</prot>, proliferation markers (<prot>PCNA</prot> and mitotic index), human papillomavirus (HPV) and angiogenesis in cervical cancer and their impact on clinical outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Tumours from 111 patients were assessed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of <prot>bcl-2</prot>, <prot>bax</prot>, <prot>p53</prot> and <prot>PCNA</prot>, by PCR for the presence of HPV-DNA, for the quantification of the mitotic index and the microvessel density (CD 31). The results were correlated with various histopathologic characteristics and survival. RESULTS: The multiple Cox's regression analysis for overall survival of all prognostic variables gave as best model: <prot>bcl-2</prot> (P&#60;0.001), lymphovascular permeation (P=0.004), mitotic index (P=0.019), tumour grade (P=0.048) and FIGO stage (P=0.070). Subanalysis was performed for the patients where the lymph node status was known (n=79). Adding the lymph node status gave as best model for overall survival <prot>bcl-2</prot> (P=0.001), lymphovascular permeation (P=0.003) and mitotic index (P=0.044). However, they hardly influenced the association. CONCLUSION: In the apoptotic pathway of cervical cancer, <prot>bcl-2</prot> is one of most important proteins. It can probably not only mediate cell death but also regulate cell growth. A better understanding of their relations will probably provide the basis for more rational cancer therapies in the future.</AbstractText>
