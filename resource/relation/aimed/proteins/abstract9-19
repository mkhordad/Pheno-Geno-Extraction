<ArticleTitle>Characterization of human hematopoietic cells with short-lived in vivo repopulating activity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Recent studies with purified hematopoietic stem cells in vitro support a model of stem cell self-renewal control that involves distinct mechanisms regulating permissiveness to and execution of lineage restriction. Such a model predicts the existence of phenotypically separable populations of hematopoietic cells that are pluripotent and either capable or incapable of extensive self-renewal. Such populations have been previously described in the mouse. We describe here the first evidence that such cells can now be identified in humans using different types of immunodeficient mice as hosts.</AbstractText>
