<AbstractText>JCV, a small DNA virus of the polyomavirus family, has been shown to infect glial cells of the central nervous system, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and immune system lymphocytes. A family of DNA binding proteins called nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) has been linked with site-coding specific transcription of cellular and viral genes and replication of some viruses, including JC virus (JCV). It is unclear which NF-1 gene product must be expressed by cells to promote JCV multiplication. Previously, it was shown that elevated levels of <prot>NF-1 class D</prot> mRNA were expressed by human brain cells that are highly susceptible to JCV infection but not by JCV nonpermissive HeLa cells. Recently, we reported that CD34(+) precursor cells of the KG-1 line, when treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), differentiated to cells with macrophage-like characteristics and lost susceptibility to JCV infection. These studies have now been extended by asking whether loss of JCV susceptibility by PMA-treated KG-1 cells is linked with alterations in levels of <prot>NF-1 class D</prot> expression. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we have found that PMA-treated KG-1 cells express mRNA that codes for all four classes of NF-1 proteins, although different levels of RNA expression were observed in the hematopoietic cells differentiated into macrophages. Northern hybridization confirms that the expression of <prot>NF-1 class D</prot> gene is lower in JCV nonpermissive PMA-treated KG-1 cells compared with non-PMA-treated cells. Further, using gel mobility shift assays, we were able to show the induction of specific NF-1-DNA complexes in KG-1 cells undergoing PMA treatment. The binding increases in direct relation to the duration of PMA treatment. These results suggest that the binding pattern of NF-1 class members may change in hematopoietic precursor cells, such as KG-1, as they undergo differentiation to macrophage-like cells. Transfection of PMA-treated KG-1 cells with an <prot>NF-1 class D</prot> expression vector restored the susceptibility of these cells to JCV infection, while the transfection of PMA-treated KG-1 cells with NF-1 class A, B, and C vectors was not able to restore JCV susceptibility. These data collectively suggest that selective expression of <prot>NF-1 class D</prot> has a regulatory role in JCV multiplication.</AbstractText>
