<AbstractText>Immunocompromised patients may have severe forms of infections. Since there is an increasing number of patients maintained under immunosuppressive therapy, we will be confronted with increasing frequency with these infectious problems. Effective treatments will be of great value. The case is described of a renal transplant with a giant orf lesion, which continued growing instead of regressing spontaneously as is observed usually. The treatment options in such patients are limited. It was decided to treat the patient with the antiviral drug cidofovir (HPMPC, Vistide). Topical cidofovir treatment resulted in complete regression of the lesion. This case is discussed in the context of the known literature on orf (ecthyma contagiosum).</AbstractText>
