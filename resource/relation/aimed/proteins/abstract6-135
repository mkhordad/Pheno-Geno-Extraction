<AbstractText>Using the method of indirect immunofluorescence the distribution of <prot>vasoactive intestinal polypeptide</prot> (<prot>VIP</prot>) and <prot>calcitonin gene-related peptide</prot> (<prot>CGRP</prot>) was investigated in autopsy specimens of human stellate ganglia following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The dramatic increase of both <prot>VIP</prot>- and <prot>CGRP</prot>-immunoreactivities in principal ganglionic neurons as well as of calcitonin gene-related peptide in perineuronal nets was revealed. It was concluded that hypoxia and myocardial ischaemia following AMI are the main inducing factors for activation of both vasoactive regulatory neuropeptide synthesis. The upregulation of <prot>VIP</prot> and <prot>CGRP</prot> expression in sympathetic ganglionic neurons may provide regulatory and trophic support to the ischaemic heart.</AbstractText>
