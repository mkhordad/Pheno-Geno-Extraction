<AbstractText>Human parvovirus B19 (B19) has been described as a causative agent of chronic anemia in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. We report an HIV-1 infected patient who had been receiving anti-retroviral therapy who showed sudden pancytopenia. Primary B19 infection was confirmed by the detection of plasma viremia and seroconversion. Although clearance required a prolonged period of time, the patient eventually cleared the B19 viral DNA from the plasma. More than likely, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), including a protease inhibitor, played a role in clearing the virus.</AbstractText>
