<AbstractText>To better understand how humans adapt to hypoxia, the levels of <prot>hemoglobin</prot> (<prot>Hb</prot>), <prot>serum erythropoietin</prot> (<prot>Epo</prot>), and <prot>vascular endothelial growth factor</prot> (<prot>VEGF</prot>) were measured in 106 patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. The results indicated that temporal hypoxic stimulation increases <prot>Hb</prot>. Furthermore, a minor increase in <prot>Epo</prot> and a substantial increase in <prot>VEGF</prot> were found. The induction in patients with severe sleep apnea was greater than that reported in other types of hypoxia. (Blood. 2001;98:1255-1257)</AbstractText>
