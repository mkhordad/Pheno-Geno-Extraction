<AbstractText>Progesterone has been used as an ingredient of anticancer drug for patients with ovarian carcinoma. However, the mechanism of anticancer effects by progesterone has not been understood. In this study, the effects of progesterone on ovarian cancer cells, SNU-840, were investigated. After the incubation with progesterone, the viability of the cells was evaluated by MTT assay. As a result, 45% of the cells were viable after 48 h of incubation with 100 microM progesterone. In addition, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay showed that the proliferation of the cells was completely inhibited by progesterone after 48 h of incubation at 100 microM concentration. Colorimetric TUNEL assay revealed the fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA, suggesting that the process of the cell death was apoptosis. The level of the <prot>p53</prot> mRNA was determined by northern blotting assay, since many apoptosis processes are mediated by up-regulation of the <prot>p53</prot> expression. The level of the <prot>p53</prot> mRNA reached its maximum at 12 h and decreased after 24 h of incubation with progesterone. In conclusion, progesterone inhibits the proliferation and elicits apoptosis of SNU-840 cells. Also, it up-regulates the <prot>p53</prot> mRNA transiently.</AbstractText>
