<AbstractText>Thirty-one physicians, 108 nurses, 105 medical students, and 126 student nurses practicing in the same medical center received a questionnaire to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes about breastfeeding. The mean knowledge score of the 139 staff member was 49.4 +/- 10.8 (The highest possible score was 73); that of the medical students was 31.2 +/- 8.9, and that of the nurse students was 39.5 +/- 7.6. Thirteen percent of the medical students vs. 68.6% of the student nurses reported that they had received breastfeeding education in school. All of the respondents had a positive attitude toward breastfeeding. Occupation and in-service education for breastfeeding could increase the knowledge score. Having been breastfed during infancy could increase both the knowledge score and positive attitude score. We suggest that breastfeeding be integrated into the curricula of both medical and nursing schools. Health professionals should receive in-service education. The mechanism of lactation, management of breast problems and infant problems, contraindications for breastfeeding, the properties of human milk and the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant should all be included.</AbstractText>
