<AbstractText>The t(11;22)(q23;q11) translocation is the most common recurrent balanced translocation described in humans. Carriers are phenotypically normal and often go undetected until diagnosis as a result of infertility investigations or following the birth of chromosomally unbalanced offspring. Efficient diagnostics of t(11;22) is important for children born to carriers of the translocation and for prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis. The translocation breakpoint on chromosome 22 is located within a region containing low copy repeats, and this site is one of the last unfilled gaps in the sequence of this chromosome. This autosome harbors multiple other low copy repeats, which have been entirely sequenced. We report a combined sequencing and fiber FISH breakpoint characterization in five translocation carriers. From one carrier a cosmid library was constructed, and two chimeric cosmids (cos4_der11 and cos6_der22) were sequenced, which showed that strong palindromes (or inverted repeats) occur on both chromosomes. The translocation breakpoints occur at the tip of both inverted repeats. The palindrome on chromosomes 22 and 11 is composed of 852 and 166 bases, respectively. Four additional carriers were studied using fiber FISH with a resolution limit of 2 kb. Analysis of breakpoints on the DNA sequence level, or at the level of fiber FISH, indicate that they occur at the same position on both chromosomes in all five carriers. Using cos6_der22, PAC 158L19 and BAC 3009A19, we demonstrate that FISH is an attractive alternative in molecular diagnostics of t(11;22), as PCR assays are not reliable, due to the presence of numerous copies of low copy repeats.</AbstractText>
