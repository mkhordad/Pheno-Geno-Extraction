<AbstractText>Mutation of both alleles of the <prot>retinoblastoma gene</prot> (<prot>RB1</prot>) initiate oncogenesis in developing human retina, but other common genomic alterations are present in the tumors. In order to sublocalize the altered genomic regions, 50 retinoblastoma tumors were examined by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The minimal regions most frequent gained were 1q31 (52%), 6p22 (44%), 2p24-p25 (30%) and 13q32-q34 (12%). The minimal region most frequently lost was 16q22 (14%). The overall total number of gains or losses evident on CGH was significantly greater in those tumors with either or both 6p or 1q gain, than in tumors with neither 6p nor 1q gain suggesting that chromosomal instability may be associated with acquisition of these changes. Genes mapping to 6p22 and 1q31 may be important in tumor development in retina subsequent to the loss of <prot>RB1</prot> alleles.</AbstractText>
