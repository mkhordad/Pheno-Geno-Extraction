<AbstractText><prot>ATM</prot>, the gene that is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia, is associated with cerebellar degeneration, abnormal proliferation of small blood vessels, and cancer. These clinically important manifestations have stimulated interest in defining the sequence variation in the <prot>ATM</prot> gene. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive survey of sequence variation in <prot>ATM</prot> in diverse human populations. The protein-encoding exons of the gene (9,168 bp) and the adjacent intron and untranslated sequences (14,661 bp) were analyzed in 93 individuals from seven major human populations. In addition, the coding sequence was analyzed in one chimpanzee, one gorilla, one orangutan, and one Old World monkey. In human <prot>ATM</prot>, 88 variant sites were discovered by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, which is 96%-100% sensitive for detection of DNA sequence variation. <prot>ATM</prot> was compared to 14 other autosomal genes for nucleotide diversity. The noncoding regions of <prot>ATM</prot> had diversity values comparable to other genes, but the coding regions had very low diversity, especially in the last 29% of the protein sequence. A test of the neutral evolution hypothesis, through use of the Hudson/Kreitman/Aguad√© statistic, revealed that this region of the human <prot>ATM</prot> gene was significantly constrained relative to that of the orangutan, the Old World monkey, and the mouse, but not relative to that of the chimpanzee or the gorilla. <prot>ATM</prot> displayed extensive linkage disequilibrium, consistent with suppression of meiotic recombination at this locus. Seven haplotypes were defined. Two haplotypes accounted for 82% of all chromosomes analyzed in all major populations; two others carrying the same D126E missense polymorphism accounted for 33% of chromosomes in Africa but were never observed outside of Africa. The high frequency of this polymorphism may be due either to a population expansion within Africa or to selective pressure.</AbstractText>
