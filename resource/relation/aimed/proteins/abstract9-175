<ArticleTitle>Prevalence and age distribution of human herpesvirus-8 specific antibodies in Hungarian blood donors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Sera of blood donors were investigated by a peptide ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay to assess the prevalence of HHV-8 infection in the Hungarian population. A 14 amino acid long synthetic oligopeptide from the carboxyterminus of <prot>orf65/small virus capsid antigen</prot> was used as antigen in the ELISA. ELISA results were confirmed by recombinant orf65 antigen Western blot. Antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen were detected by the immunofluorescence assay. Nine of 12 sera obtained from patients with classical Kaposi sarcoma were reactive by ELISA whereas all were positive by immunofluorescence. Four of 482 (0.83%) healthy blood donors had anti-orf65 peptide antibodies and 17/1089 (1.56%) had antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen. In a group of children ages 1-14 years, antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen (0/29) were not detected. The prevalence of antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen showed a moderate but significant increase in correlation with senescence. In the Kaposi sarcoma patients, the titre of antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen was significantly higher than in the healthy seropositive donors. The overall HHV-8 seroprevalence by the two assays was 2.28% (11/482) in the Hungarian blood donor group.</AbstractText>
