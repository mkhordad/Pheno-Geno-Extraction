TI - Involvement of <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  signaling in a cartilage cap in osteochondroma .
AB - This study describes the distributions of <prot>  bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) - 2 </prot>  as well as mRNAs for <prot>  BMP receptor type IB </prot>  ( <prot>  BMPRIB </prot>  ) . collagen types II ( <prot>  Col II </prot>  ) and III ( <prot>  Col III </prot>  ) in a growing AMPPPP quot ; cartilage cap AMPPPP quot ; of osteochondroma .
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical study were performed using histological sections obtained during surgery .
 <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  was detected in mesenchymal cells in the outer fibrous layer and chondrocytes in the inner cartilaginous matrix , positive for <prot>  Col III </prot>  and <prot>  Col II </prot>  , respectively .
 <prot> BMPRIB </prot>  mRNA was distributed in chondrocytes .
This is the first study to provide observational evidence of the involvement of <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  signaling in the pathogenesis of cartilage cap of osteochondroma. and suggests the role of <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  in the growth of cartilage cap in osteochondroma .
