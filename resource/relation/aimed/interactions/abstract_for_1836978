TI - Specific activation of <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  tyrosine phosphatases by B - type cyclins : evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins .
PG - 1181 - 94 AB - Two previously unidentified human <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  genes have been isolated , <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  and <prot>  cdc25B </prot>  .
Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast .
Microinjection of anti - <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  and <prot>  cdc25B </prot>  display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several - fold , in the absence of cdc2 , by stoichiometric addition of either <prot>  cyclin B1 </prot>  or B2 but not A or D1 .
Association between <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  cyclin B1 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  </p2>  was detected in the HeLa cells .
These findings indicate that B - type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  protein kinase , but also activate the <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  tyrosine phosphatase , of which <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  is the physiological substrate .
A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected .
This region is absent in <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  phosphatases .
The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  by intermolecular interaction with <prot>  cyclin B </prot>  .
