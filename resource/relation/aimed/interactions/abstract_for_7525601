TI - Making a connection : direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins .
PG - 1049 - 60 AB - In epidermal cells , keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin - mediated cytoskeletal architectures .
 <prot> Desmoplakin </prot>  ( <prot>  DPI </prot>  ) , a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain , has been implicated in this interaction , although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes , and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful .
In this report , we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes .
We show that the carboxy terminal AMPPPP quot ; tail AMPPPP quot ; of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates directly with the amino terminal AMPPPP quot ; head AMPPPP quot ; of type II epidermal keratins , including <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  K1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  K2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  K6 </prot>  </p2>  .
We have engineered and purified recombinant <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p1>  head and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p2>  tail , and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution - binding assays and by ligand blot assays .
This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins , <prot>  vimentin </prot>  , or with type I keratins , providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types .
We have identified an 18 - amino acid residue stretch in the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p1>  head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p2>  tail binding .
This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder .
