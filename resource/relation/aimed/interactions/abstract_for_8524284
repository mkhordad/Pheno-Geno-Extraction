TI - Cloning of two proximal sequence element - binding transcription factor subunits ( gamma and delta ) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  .
PG - 1 - 9 AB - The <prot>  proximal sequence element ( PSE ) - binding transcription factor </prot>  ( <prot>  PTF </prot>  ) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II - and RNA polymerase III - transcribed small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes .
We previously have shown that <prot>  PTF </prot>  purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated <prot>  <prot>  PTF </prot>  alpha </prot>  , - beta , - gamma , and - delta .
We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma and <prot>  PTF </prot>  delta , as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native <prot>  PTF </prot>  complex in HeLa extracts .
Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four <prot>  PTF </prot>  subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex ; they further show that the <prot>  PTF </prot>  so defined , including the gamma and delta subunits specifically , is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes .
Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) with <prot>  PTF </prot>  , consistent with the previous report of a <prot>  PTF </prot>  - related complex ( <prot>  SNAPc </prot>  ) containing substoichiometric levels of <prot>  TBP </prot>  and a component ( <prot>  SNAPc43 </prot>  ) identical in sequence to the <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma reported here .
Glutathione S - transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma and <prot>  PTF </prot>  delta with <prot>  TBP </prot>  , consistent either with the natural association of <prot>  TBP </prot>  with <prot>  PTF </prot>  in a semistable <prot>  TBP </prot>  - <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE - bound <prot>  PTF </prot>  and TATA - bound <prot>  TBP </prot>  during promoter activation .
In addition , we show that in extracts depleted of <prot>  TBP </prot>  and <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factors , transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant <prot>  TBP </prot>  but not by <prot>  TFIID </prot>  or <prot>  TFIIIB </prot>  , indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a <prot>  TBP </prot>  complex different from the one used for mRNA - encoding genes .
