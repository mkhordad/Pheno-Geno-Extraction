TI - <prot>  Spectrin cagliari </prot>  . an Ala -- GTTTTT Gly substitution in helix 1 of <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  repeat 17 that severely disrupts the structure and self - association of the erythrocyte spectrin heterodimer .
PG - 22656 - 62 AB - The spectrin tetramer , the principal structural element of the red cell membrane skeleton , is formed by stable head - to - head self - association of two spectrin heterodimers .
The self - association site appears to be formed by interactions between helices 1 and 2 of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  </p1>  repeat 17 of one dimer with helix 3 of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  alpha spectrin </prot>  </p2>  repeat 1 of the other dimer to form two combined alpha - beta triple - helical segments .
The head of the heterodimer appears to involve similar intradimer interactions .
We describe the first example of an amino acid substitution in helix 1 of this combined alpha - beta triple - helical segment , which , although relatively minor , profoundly impairs tetramer formation .
Strikingly , low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy of isolated spectrin dimers reveals that this mutation also severely disrupts the head of the heterodimer causing it to be open .
Following linkage studies which were most consistent with a <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  gene mutation , a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018 , resulting in an Ala -- GTTTTT Gly substitution in the first helical domain of <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  repeat 17 .
Because glycine is a strong helix breaker , this change is predicted to disrupt the conformation of this helical domain .
Our results indicate that this helical domain must play direct roles in the alpha - beta interdimer interactions that form the self - association site of the tetramer and in the alpha - beta intradimer interactions at the head of the heterodimer .
