TI - Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  UBF </prot>  </p1>  blocked by <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  gene product .
PG - 177 - 80 AB - The protein encoded by the <prot>  retinoblastoma susceptibility gene </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator .
As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA , we considered that <prot>  Rb </prot>  might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus .
Here we report that ( 1 ) there is an accumulation of <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription ; ( 2 ) addition of <prot>  Rb </prot>  to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I ; ( 3 ) this inhibition requires a functional <prot>  Rb </prot>  pocket ; and ( 4 ) <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  UBF </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  upstream binding factor </prot>  </p2>  ) in vitro .
This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation , which demonstrated an interaction between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  UBF </prot>  </p2>  .
These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which <prot>  Rb </prot>  suppresses cell growth , namely that <prot>  Rb </prot>  directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes .
