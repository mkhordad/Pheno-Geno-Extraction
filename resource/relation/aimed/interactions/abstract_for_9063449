TI - The catalytic domain of activated <prot>  collagenase I </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TIMP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
PG - 81 - 8 AB - Here , we describe the production of <prot>  recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  rTIMP - 1 </prot>  ) and wild - type and mutant human <prot>  collagenase type I </prot>  ( <prot>  rMMP - 1 </prot>  ) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system .
Wild - type <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , as well as the <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  mutant lacking the C - terminal hemopexin - like domain [ des - ( 248 - 450 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  ] , exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with <prot>  trypsin </prot>  or 4 - aminophenylmercuric acetate .
Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of <prot>  rTIMP </prot>  .
Deletion of the complete active - site [ des - ( 161 - 228 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  ] within the catalytic domain , or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain ( His199 ) , generates stable forms of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  proteins which are unable to digest <prot>  collagen type I </prot>  or <prot>  beta - casein </prot>  .
In addition to co - immunoprecipitation analysis , we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized <prot>  rTIMP </prot>  to determine the structural requirements of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  to form complexes with its inhibitor .
Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild - type and C - terminal mutant des - ( 248 - 450 ) - <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  proteins are able to form complexes with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TIMP </prot>  </p2>  .
Neither mutation of His199 , nor deletion mutants des - ( 161 - 228 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  and des - ( 161 - 228 / 248 - 450 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , interact with <prot>  TIMP </prot>  .
This demonstrates that the C - terminal hemopexin domain of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , in contrast to the corresponding regions of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  gelatinase A </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  gelatinase B </prot>  </p1>  , does not interact with <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TIMP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
In summary , we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TIMP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  , which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  .
