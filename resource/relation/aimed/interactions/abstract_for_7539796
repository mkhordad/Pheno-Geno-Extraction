TI - Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved , function - related epitope topography among helical cytokines .
PG - 14007 - 14 AB - By rational mutagenesis , receptor - specific functional analysis , and visualization of complex formation in solution , we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ciliary neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  CNTF </prot>  </p1>  ) with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CNTFR alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and not with the beta - components , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  and <prot>  LIFR </prot>  .
In the crystal structure , the side chains of these residues , which are located in helix A , the AB loop , helix B , and helix D , are surface accessible and are clustered in space , thus constituting an epitope for <prot>  CNTFR alpha </prot>  .
By the same analysis , a partial epitope for <prot>  gp130 </prot>  was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha - epitope .
Superposition of the <prot>  CNTF </prot>  and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on <prot>  CNTF </prot>  is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone .
Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha - and beta - receptors on <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines .
In each case , epitope I is utilized by the specificity - conferring component , whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components .
Thus , in addition to a common fold , helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related .
