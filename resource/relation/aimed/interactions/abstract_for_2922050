TI - Structure of tumour necrosis factor .
PG - 225 - 8 AB - Tumour necrosis factor is a trimeric molecule , each subunit of which consists of an antiparallel beta - sandwich .
Individual subunits from the trimer by a novel edge - to - face packing of beta - sheets .
A comparison of the subunit fold with that of other proteins reveals a remarkable similarity to the ' jelly - roll ' structural motif characteristic of viral coat proteins .
