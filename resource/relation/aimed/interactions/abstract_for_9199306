TI - Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by <prot>  YY1 </prot>  .
PG - 3723 - 32 AB - The four C - terminal GLI - Kruppel type zinc fingers of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain .
Previous reports have proposed DNA - bending and activator - quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger - mediated repression .
In addition , previous work indicated that <prot>  p300 </prot>  and <prot>  CBP </prot>  might be involved in <prot>  YY1 </prot>  - mediated repression .
We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger - mediated repression .
The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA - binding functions was determined by using a structure - and - function approach .
We show that zinc finger 2 of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression .
However , a survey of a panel of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated , which argues against the DNA - bending model for repression .
We show that the physical interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  p300 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  , a coactivator for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CREB </prot>  </p2>  , is not sufficient for repression of <prot>  CREB </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Our studies indicate that <prot>  YY1 </prot>  functions as an activator - specific repressor .
Repression of <prot>  CTF - 1 </prot>  - directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between <prot>  YY1 </prot>  and this activator .
In contrast , physical interaction is not necessary for <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to repress <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - and <prot>  CREB </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Rather , the repression likely reflects an ability of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery .
Taken together , our results suggest that <prot>  YY1 </prot>  employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator - specific repression .
