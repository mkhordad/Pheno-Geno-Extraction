TI - Mutational analysis of <prot>  thrombopoietin </prot>  for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites .
PG - 20595 - 602 AB - <prot>  Thrombopoietin </prot>  ( <prot>  TPO </prot>  ) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets .
We sought to characterize how <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  TPO </prot>  </p1>  binds and activates its receptor , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
The <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  - like domain of <prot>  TPO </prot>  ( TPO1 - 153 ) has been fused to the <prot>  gIII </prot>  coat protein of M13 bacteriophage .
Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent - exposed , based on a homology model .
Phage enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the <prot>  TPO </prot>  receptor and five anti - <prot>  TPO1 </prot>  - 153 monoclonal antibodies .
Mutations at mostly positively charged residues ( Asp8 , Lys14 , Lys52 , Lys59 , Lys136 , Lys138 , Arg140 ) caused the greatest reduction in receptor - binding affinity .
Most of these residues mapped to helices - 1 and - 4 and a loop region between helix - 1 and helix - 2 .
Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked <prot>  TPO </prot>  binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix - 4 .
In contrast , the other three monoclonal antibodies , which were effective at blocking <prot>  TPO </prot>  activity but did not block initial binding of <prot>  TPO </prot>  to its receptor , had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3 .
These results suggest that <prot>  TPO </prot>  has two distinct receptor - binding sites that function to dimerize <prot>  TPO </prot>  receptors in a sequential fashion .
