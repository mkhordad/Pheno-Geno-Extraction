TI - The splicing factor <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  mediates critical protein - protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer - dependent splicing .
PG - 1356 - 68 AB - The splicing factor U2AF ( U2 snRNP auxiliary factor ) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
 <prot> U2AF65 </prot>  binds specifically to 3 ' splice sites , but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  .
Here , we report that <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer - dependent splicing .
Nuclear extracts deficient in <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  were inactive ; however , both constitutive and enhancer - dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  .
In vitro protein - RNA interaction studies with pre - mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  directly mediates interactions between <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  and proteins bound to the enhancers .
Thus , <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  functions as a bridge between <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  and the enhancer complex to recruit <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  to the adjacent intron .
