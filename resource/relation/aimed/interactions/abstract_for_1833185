TI - <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  phosphorylation is required for its interaction with cyclin .
PG - 3311 - 9 AB - Activation of the <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  protein kinase at different stages of the cell cycle is regulated by post - translational modifications and interactions with cyclins .
We show that in vitro translated human <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  binds very poorly to A and B cyclins , unless it has been preincubated with a Xenopus egg extract .
This results in the phosphorylation of <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  which allows binding to cyclins .
The replacement of Thr161 , a residue conserved and phosphorylated in other protein kinases , with valine inhibits <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  association with A and B cyclins .
In addition , mutations in the amino - terminus of <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  and within the conserved ' PSTAIR ' region strongly inhibit binding .
The Thr161Val mutation causes a lethal phenotype in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , while replacement of Thr161 with glutamic acid , potentially mimicking phosphorylation , causes uncoordination of mitosis and multiple cytokinesis .
These results suggest that a threonine phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle is involved in regulating <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  function .
