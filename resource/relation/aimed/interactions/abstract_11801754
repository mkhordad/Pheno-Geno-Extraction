TI - Assaying of <prot>  tumor necrosis factor alpha </prot>  , complement factors , and <prot>  alpha - 1 - antitrypsin </prot>  in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions .
AB - The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of <prot>  tumor necrosis factor - alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  ) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  , <prot>  alpha - 1 - antitrypsin </prot>  ( <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  ) , and complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion .
One hundred forty - five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed .
 <prot> TNFalpha </prot>  , <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  , and complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods .
Serous effusions were classified as follows : 102 exudates and 43 transudates .
All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion .
In the stepwise discriminant analysis , four variables were selected , producing a significant discriminant function ( p LTTTTT 0.001 ) .
Their order of selection was <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  effusion , <prot>  C4 </prot>  serum , <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  - effusion , and <prot>  C3 </prot>  effusion .
Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value ( in diagnosing exudates versus transudates ) giving sensitivity = 93.14 % ; specificity = 90.70 % ; positive predictive value = 95.96 % ; negative predictive value = 84.78 % .
Determination of <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  , complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  , and <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions , particularly in those patients with malignant disease .
Moreover , the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power .
