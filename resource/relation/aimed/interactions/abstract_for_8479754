TI - Two potentially oncogenic cyclins , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  , share common properties of subunit configuration , tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  protein PG - 1377 - 84 AB - Originally identified as a ' mitotic cyclin ' , <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity , susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor - suppressor protein , properties which are indicative of an <prot>  S - phase - promoting factor </prot>  ( <prot>  SPF </prot>  ) as well as a candidate proto - oncogene .
Other recent studies have identified human <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PRAD1 </prot>  ) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto - oncogene .
However , the specific enzymatic activities and , hence , the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved .
In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins , cyclin - dependent protein kinase subunits ( cdks ) and the <prot>  Rb </prot>  tumor - suppressor protein .
The distribution of <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells .
Moreover , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and , like <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  </p1>  , was readily phosphorylated by <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  pp60c - src </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  in vitro .
In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p9Ckshs1 </prot>  </p2>  , a Cdk - binding subunit .
Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing 's sarcoma cells demonstrated that <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is associated with both <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p34cdc2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p33cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  , and that <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity .
Immobilized , recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the <prot>  p105Rb </prot>  protein .
This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry , including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein , that may ultimately relate membrane - mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression .
