TI - Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding <prot>  KDR </prot>  and <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  receptors .
Generation of receptor - selective <prot>  VEGF </prot>  variants by site - directed mutagenesis .
PG - 5638 - 46 AB - <prot>  Vascular endothelial growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  VEGF </prot>  ) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli .
 <prot> VEGF </prot>  mediates endothelial cell proliferation , angiogenesis , vascular growth , and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors , <prot>  kinase insert domain - containing receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  KDR </prot>  ) / <prot>  fetal liver kinase 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  Flk - 1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  .
Alanine - scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in <prot>  VEGF </prot>  that mediates binding to <prot>  KDR </prot>  / <prot>  Flk - 1 </prot>  .
Arg82 , Lys84 and His86 , located in a hairpin loop , were found to be critical for binding <prot>  KDR </prot>  / <prot>  Flk - 1 </prot>  , while negatively charged residues , Asp63 , Glu64 , and Glu67 , were associated with <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  binding .
A <prot>  VEGF </prot>  model based on <prot>  PDGFb </prot>  indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer .
Mutations within the <prot>  KDR </prot>  site had minimal effect on <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  binding , and mutants deficient in <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  binding did not affect <prot>  KDR </prot>  binding .
Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking <prot>  KDR </prot>  affinity ; however , <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  deficient mutants induced normal proliferation .
These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the <prot>  VEGF </prot>  dimer that cross - link cell surface receptors , triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis .
Furthermore , this mutational analysis implicates <prot>  KDR </prot>  , but not <prot>  FLT - 1 </prot>  , in <prot>  VEGF </prot>  induction of endothelial cell proliferation .
