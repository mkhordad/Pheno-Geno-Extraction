TI - Interactions among members of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein family analyzed with a yeast two - hybrid system .
PG - 9238 - 42 AB - Interactions of the <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  protein with itself and other members of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family , including <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  , were explored with a yeast two - hybrid system .
Fusion proteins were created by linking <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins to a LexA DNA - binding domain or a B42 trans - activation domain .
Protein - protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ ( beta - galactosidase ) gene under control of a LexA - dependent operator .
This approach gave evidence for <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  protein homodimerization .
 <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot> Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  also interacted with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  </p2>  and with the dominant inhibitors <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  </p2>  .
 <prot> Bcl - X - L </prot>  displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins as <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  .
Use of deletion mutants of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  suggested that <p1  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein , since a LexA protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 83 - 218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 1 - 81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 83 - 218 .
In contrast to LexA / <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  fusion proteins , expression of a LexA / <prot>  Bax </prot>  protein was lethal to yeast .
This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  , <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  , or <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  but not those containing <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  ( an alternatively spliced form of <prot>  Bcl - X </prot>  that lacks a well - conserved 63 - amino acid region ) .
The findings suggest a model whereby <prot>  Bax </prot>  and <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  differentially regulate <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  function , and indicate that requirements for <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  heterodimerization may be different from those for <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  homodimerization .
