TI - The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with <prot>  CSB protein </prot>  and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH .
PG - 555 - 64 AB - The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome ( CS ) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype .
CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes .
The cloned <prot>  CSB </prot>  gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast <prot>  Snf2 </prot>  protein , a component of the transcriptional regulator <prot>  Swi </prot>  / <prot>  Snf </prot>  .
We report the cloning of the <prot>  CSA </prot>  cDNA , which can encode a WD repeat protein .
Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS - A cell lines .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> CSA </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  protein interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CSB </prot>  </p2>  protein and with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p44 </prot>  </p2>  protein , a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH .
These observations suggest that the products of the <prot>  CSA </prot>  and <prot>  CSB </prot>  genes are involved in transcription .
