TI - The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  </p1>  - susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human <prot>  <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  - associated factor </prot>  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 3115 - 9 AB - <prot>  RB </prot>  , the protein product of the <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  tumor - suppressor gene , regulates the activity of specific transcription factors .
This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism .
Here we report that stimulation of <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - mediated transcription by <prot>  RB </prot>  is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells .
These cells contain a temperature - sensitive mutation in the <prot>  <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  - associated factor </prot>  <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  , first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein <prot>  CCG1 </prot>  .
The stimulation of <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - mediated transcription by <prot>  RB </prot>  in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild - type human <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  RB </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  </p2>  in vitro and in vivo .
These results suggest that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RB </prot>  </p1>  can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with <prot>  TFIID </prot>  , in particular with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  </p2>  .
