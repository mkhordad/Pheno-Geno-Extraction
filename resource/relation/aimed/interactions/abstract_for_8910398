TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p1>  recruitment by two distinct ligand - induced , tyrosine - phosphorylated docking sites in the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  intracellular domain .
PG - 27954 - 61 AB - Recent work has shown that <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  induces activation of the JAK - STAT signaling pathway .
To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) protein recruitment to the <prot>  <prot>  interleukin 10 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  ) receptor </prot>  , the STAT proteins activated by <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
In all cells tested , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  activated <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p2>  and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <prot> IL - 10 </prot>  </p1>  also activated <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Stat5 </prot>  </p2>  in Ba / F3 cells that stably expressed the murine <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Using a structure - function mutagenesis approach , two tyrosine residues ( Tyr427 and Tyr477 ) in the intracellular domain of the murine <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p2>  but not for <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  or Stat5 .
Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  but not <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  and blocked <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  - induced <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  phosphorylation in a cell - free system .
In contrast , tyrosine - phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  or block <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  activation .
These data demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p1>  but not <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  or <prot>  Stat5 </prot>  is directly recruited to the ligand - activated <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine .
This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand - activatable , tyrosine - containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains .
