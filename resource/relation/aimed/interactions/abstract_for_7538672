TI - The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  </p1>  protein binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RIZ </prot>  </p2>  , a zinc - finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus <prot>  E1A </prot>  protein .
PG - 4467 - 71 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma protein </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) is a target of viral oncoproteins .
To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins , we have searched cDNA libraries for <prot>  Rb </prot>  - binding proteins .
We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein <prot>  RIZ </prot>  from rat and human cells .
 <prot> RIZ </prot>  is a 250 - kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc - finger motifs .
It contains an <prot>  Rb </prot>  - binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of <prot>  E1A </prot>  .
A domain is conserved between <prot>  RIZ </prot>  and the <prot>  PRDI - BF1 </prot>  / <prot>  Blimp - 1 </prot>  differentiation factor .
Other motifs of <prot>  RIZ </prot>  include putative GTPase and SH3 ( src homology domain 3 ) domains .
 <prot> RIZ </prot>  is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues .
It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined .
While the function of <prot>  RIZ </prot>  is not yet clear , its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for <prot>  RIZ </prot>  in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma .
