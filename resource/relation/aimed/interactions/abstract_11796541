TI - Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease : review of population association studies .
AB - Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis .
Accordingly , a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules <prot>  tumour necrosis factors ( TNF ) alpha </prot>  and beta , <prot>  transforming growth factors ( TGF ) beta1 </prot>  and 2 , <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 1 </prot>  and its receptor antagonist ( <prot>  IL 1ra </prot>  ) , <prot>  CD14 </prot>  ( the receptor for lipopolysaccharide ) , P and E selectins , and <prot>  platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( PECAM ) 1 </prot>  .
Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting , the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease .
