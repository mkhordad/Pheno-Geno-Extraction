TI - Protein binding and signaling properties of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  suggest a unique effector function .
PG - 4954 - 9 AB - Human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  was first characterized as a <prot>  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  binding protein </prot>  based on the properties of its carboxyl - terminal domain .
We now show that full - length <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with activated <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient <prot>  RAS </prot>  binding .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with the AMPPPP quot ; effector domain AMPPPP quot ; of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  and employs some <prot>  RAS </prot>  determinants that are common to , and others that are distinct from , those required for the binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RAF1 </prot>  </p1>  , a known <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  effector .
The same domain of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  that binds <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  also interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , extending the similarity between <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  and other <prot>  RAS </prot>  effectors .
When expressed in mammalian cells , the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p1>  binding domain of <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p2>  can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker .
The amino - terminal domain of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  contains a proline - rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) binding regions .
This <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  sequence shows preferential binding to the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  ABL - SH3 </prot>  </p2>  domain in vitro .
Moreover , the amino - terminal domain of <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  directly associates with , and is tyrosine phosphorylated by , <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  c - ABL </prot>  </p2>  .
In addition , <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals .
These data suggest that <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  is able to mediate multiple signals .
A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  regulation .
