TI - A cellular protein that competes with <prot>  SV40 T antigen </prot>  for binding to the <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product .
PG - 160 - 2 AB - Tumour - suppressor genes , such as the human <prot>  retinoblastoma susceptibility gene </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) , are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation .
This role is indicated , in part , by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus - mediated <prot>  Rb </prot>  replacement .
How <prot>  Rb </prot>  acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses , and that two regions of <prot>  Rb </prot>  essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells .
These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of <prot>  Rb </prot>  and thereby mediate its function .
We report here the identification of one such human cellular <prot>  <prot>  Rb </prot>  - associated protein </prot>  of relative molecular mass 46 , 000 ( 46K ) ( <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  ) .
Two lines of evidence support the notion that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  simian virus 40 T antigen </prot>  </p1>  have homologous <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  - binding properties : first , several mutated <prot>  Rb </prot>  proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  ; and second , both T antigen and T peptide ( amino acids 101 - 118 ) were able to compete with <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  for binding to <prot>  Rb </prot>  .
The apparent targeting of the <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important .
