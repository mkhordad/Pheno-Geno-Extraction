TI - The molar ratio of serum <prot>  retinol - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  RBP </prot>  ) to <prot>  transthyretin </prot>  ( <prot>  TTR </prot>  ) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum <prot>  retinol - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  RBP </prot>  ) to <prot>  transthyretin </prot>  ( <prot>  TTR </prot>  ) to determine vitamin A ( VA ) status during infection .
DESIGN : We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the <prot>  RBP </prot>  / <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status .
In this clinical trial , children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA ( 200 000 IU ) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA ( 5000 IU ) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge .
SETTING : Lwiro pediatric hospital , Province of South Kivu , Democratic Republic of Congo .
SUBJECTS : A total of 900 children aged 0 - 72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996 .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : <prot>  RBP </prot>  / <prot>  TTR </prot>  molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation .
RESULTS : After 7 days hospitalisation , molar <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio ( mean+ / - s.d. ) of infected children ( C - reactive proteins GTTTTT 10 mg / l ) was 0.67+ / - 0.31 in the high - dose group ( n = 81 ) , 0.74+ / - 0.44 in the low dose group ( n = 71 ) and 0.73+ / - 0.39 in the placebo group ( n = 81 ) . These values did not differ significantly ( one - way ANOVA P = 0.472 ) . In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations LTTTTT 0.70 micromol / l , changes in <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups ( one - way ANOVA P = 0.548 ) . CONCLUSIONS : In this population of malnourished hospitalised children , molar <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.
