TI - Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters : common notes but different melodies .
AB - The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na ( + ) - dependent transport systems .
Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents , including antidepressants and stimulants .
Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways .
In the past five years , several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning .
This regulated trafficking can result in rapid ( within minutes ) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms .
Many of the same signaling molecules , including <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  ( <prot>  PKC </prot>  ) , <prot>  tyrosine kinase , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  P13 - K </prot>  ) , and protein phosphatase , regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters .
In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways , transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters .
In fact , some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules .
Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters , it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking , but except for the molecules , the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different .
It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies .
