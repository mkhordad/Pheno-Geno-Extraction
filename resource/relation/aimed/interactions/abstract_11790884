TI - Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells .
AB - Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10 , 000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi 's Sarcoma - associated Virus ( KSHV ) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 ( HHV8 ) and Human T cell leukemia virus - 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) .
We performed cell - free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived <prot>  CD34 </prot>  + cells using semi - purified HHV8 and a mature <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  dependent T cell line , KIT 225 , using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV - 1 .
Thirty days post infection , mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis .
More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two - fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived <prot>  CD34 </prot>  + cells .
Of these 400 , <prot>  interferon regulatory factor 4 </prot>  ( <prot>  IRF4 </prot>  ) , <prot>  cyclin B2 </prot>  , TBP - associated factor , eukaryotic elongation factor and <prot>  pim 2 </prot>  were up - regulated more than 3.5 fold .
In contrast , less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two - fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV - 1 .
Of these , only <prot>  cdc7 </prot>  was up - regulated more than 3.5 fold .
These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention .
