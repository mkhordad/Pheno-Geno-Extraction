TI - Analysis of the human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  </p1>  / human <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  binding interface at the amino acid level : proposed mechanism of interaction .
PG - 1319 - 33 AB - The interaction between <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  ) is the initial and most specific step in the <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  signaling pathway .
Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  - inhibiting molecules .
We studied the human <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  hIL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ) / <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site - directed mutagenesis .
Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding - free energy .
These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition .
Following this hypothesis , we altered in <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  hIL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  hIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other .
We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  complex and their ability to transduce the signal .
This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue - clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions , suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation .
The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis .
Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha - subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved .
