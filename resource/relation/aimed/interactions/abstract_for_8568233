TI - Characterization of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  adenosine deaminase </prot>  </p1>  binding to human <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  on T cells and its biologic role in immune response .
PG - 1349 - 55 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , a T cell activation Ag , also known as <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is directly associated with <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  adenosine deaminase </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines .
In the present study , we examined both the binding of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  and the functional consequences of this interaction .
We found that <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  was associated with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  on T cell lines lacking either <prot>  ADA </prot>  or <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  enzymatic activity , indicating that the association between <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p2>  did not require enzymatic activity .
Moreover , using immunoelectron microscopy , we demonstrated that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  and <prot>  ADA </prot>  co - localized on the cell surface , but not inside cells , suggesting that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  did not transport <prot>  ADA </prot>  to the surface .
In keeping with this observation , we showed that human <prot>  CD26 </prot>  - transfected murine pre - B cell lines lacking human <prot>  ADA </prot>  acquired <prot>  ADA </prot>  from an extracellular source .
More importantly , adenosine in the absence of cell surface <prot>  ADA </prot>  inhibited T cell proliferation and <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  production induced by various stimuli .
On the other hand , cells expressing <prot>  ADA </prot>  and <prot>  CD26 </prot>  on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine .
These data suggest that <prot>  ADA </prot>  on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  binds to cell surface <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  , and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine .
