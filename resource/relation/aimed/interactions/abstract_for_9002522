TI - <prot>  Bcl - x ( L ) </prot>  forms an ion channel in synthetic lipid membranes .
PG - 353 - 7 AB - <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - related proteins are critical regulators of cell survival that are localized to the outer mitochondrial , outer nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum membranes .
Despite their physiological importance , the biochemical function of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - related proteins has remained elusive .
The three - dimensional structure of <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  , an inhibitor of apoptosis , was recently shown to be similar to the structures of the pore - forming domains of bacterial toxins .
A key feature of these pore - forming domains is the ability to form ion channels in biological membranes .
Here we demonstrate that <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  shares this functional feature .
Like the bacterial toxins , <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  can insert into either synthetic lipid vesicles or planar lipid bilayers and form an ion - conducting channel .
This channel is pH - sensitive and becomes cation - selective at physiological pH .
The ion - conducting channel ( s ) formed by <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  display multiple conductance states that have identical ion selectivity .
Together , these data suggest that <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  may maintain cell survival by regulating the permeability of the intracellular membranes to which it is distributed .
