TI - Analysis of the oligomerization of <prot>  myogenin </prot>  and <prot>  E2A </prot>  products in vivo using a two - hybrid assay system .
PG - 17498 - 501 AB - Members of the helix - loop - helix ( HLH ) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo - and heterodimers .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Myogenin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is a muscle - specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins , such as the <prot>  E2A </prot>  gene products <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  E12 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p2>  .
We describe a method for detection of protein - protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA - binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of <prot>  VP - 16 </prot>  linked to another .
We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin 's ability to dimerize .
The results show that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  myogenin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  heterodimerizes with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  E12 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p2>  in vivo , but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent .
Peptide growth factors , as well as the immediate early gene products <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  , <prot>  v - Fos </prot>  , and <prot>  c - Myc </prot>  , inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with <prot>  E2A </prot>  products .
