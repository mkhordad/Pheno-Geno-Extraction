TI - Activation of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  </p1>  decreases phosphorylation of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  at sites that negatively regulate its DNA - binding activity .
PG - 573 - 84 AB - In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites , three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  glycogen synthase kinase 3 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  GSK - 3 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  DNA - binding domain ( residues 227 - 252 ) .
Activation of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  </p1>  results in rapid , site - specific dephosphorylation of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased <prot>  AP - 1 </prot>  - binding activity .
Phosphorylation of recombinant human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  proteins in vitro by <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  GSK - 3 </prot>  </p2>  decreases their DNA - binding activity .
Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans - activation ability of <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  at least 10 - fold .
We propose that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  is present in resting cells in a latent , phosphorylated form that can be activated by site - specific dephosphorylation in response to <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  </p2>  activation .
