TI - Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins .
PG - 7632 - 6 AB - Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are members of the <prot>  transforming growth factor beta </prot>  superfamily .
Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine - ( threonine ) kinase receptors .
Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs ( <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  ) , which is distantly related to <prot>  DAF - 4 </prot>  , a <prot>  BMP type II receptor </prot>  from Caenorhabditis elegans .
In transfected COS - 1 cells , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  osteogenic protein ( OP ) - 1 </prot>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  BMP - 7 </prot>  </p1>  , and less efficiently <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  BMP - 4 </prot>  </p1>  , bound to <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  .
 <prot> BMPR - II </prot>  bound ligands only weakly alone , but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs .
Binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  OP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  BMP - 7 </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  was also observed in nontransfected cell lines .
Moreover , a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  OP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  BMP - 7 </prot>  </p2>  .
