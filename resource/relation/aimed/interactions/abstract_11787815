TI - Apoptotic proteins .
 <prot> p53 </prot>  and <prot>  c - myc </prot>  related pathways .
AB - <prot>  c - Myc </prot>  and <prot>  p53 </prot>  are two proteins that have critical roles in the regulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle .
The authors review how these two proteins are thought to control the opposing events of proliferation and apoptosis and examine whether their well - documented biological roles in tumorigenesis can be applied to the vascular system .
