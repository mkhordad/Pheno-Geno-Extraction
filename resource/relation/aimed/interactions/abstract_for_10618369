TI - Structural interactions of fibroblast growth factor receptor with its ligands .
PG - 49 - 54 AB - Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) effect cellular responses by binding to FGF receptors ( FGFRs ) .
FGF bound to extracellular domains on the FGFR in the presence of heparin activates the cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase through autophosphorylation .
We have crystallized a complex between human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGF1 </prot>  </p1>  and a two - domain extracellular fragment of human <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p2>  .
The crystal structure , determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction analysis of the selenomethionyl protein , is a dimeric assemblage of 1:1 ligand :receptor complexes .
FGF is bound at the junction between the two domains of one FGFR , and two such units are associated through receptor :receptor and secondary ligand :receptor interfaces .
Sulfate ion positions appear to mark the course of heparin binding between FGF molecules through a basic region on receptor D2 domains .
This dimeric assemblage provides a structural mechanism for FGF signal transduction .
