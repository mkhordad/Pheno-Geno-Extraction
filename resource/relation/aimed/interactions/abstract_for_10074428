TI - Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor , a human ortholog of mouse GITR .
PG - 215 - 8 AB - The tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and TNF receptor ( TNFR ) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions , including cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] .
We have identified a new TNF - related ligand , designated human <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  GITR </p1>  ligand </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) , and its human receptor ( <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  hGITR </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) , an ortholog of the recently discovered murine <prot>  glucocorticoid - induced TNFR - related ( <prot>  mGITR </prot>  ) protein </prot>  [ 4 ] .
The <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  gene mapped to chromosome 1q23 , near the gene for the TNF homolog <prot>  Fas </prot>  / <prot>  CD95 ligand </prot>  [ 5 ] .
The <prot>  hGITR </prot>  gene mapped to chromosome 1p36 , near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [ 1 ] [ 6 ] .
We found <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  mRNA in several peripheral tissues , and detected <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells .
The levels of <prot>  hGITR </prot>  mRNA in tissues were generally low ; in peripheral blood T cells , however , antigen - receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of <prot>  hGITR </prot>  transcripts .
Cotransfection of <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti - apoptotic transcription factor <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  , via a pathway that appeared to involve <prot>  TNFR - associated factor 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  TRAF2 </prot>  ) [ 7 ] and <prot>  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  - inducing kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  NIK </prot>  ) [ 8 ] .
Cotransfection of <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen - receptor - induced cell death .
Thus , <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues .
