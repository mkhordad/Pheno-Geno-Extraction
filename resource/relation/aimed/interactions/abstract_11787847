TI - A comparative study of <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  and <prot>  stromelysin - 3 </prot>  expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum .
AB - An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma - carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so - called AMPPPP quot ; de novo AMPPPP quot ; carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity .
Despite the fact that they are often quite small , these lesions appear to be more aggressive ( i.e. , greater likelihood of lymph - node metastases ) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma .
The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule ( <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  ) and protease [ <prot>  stromelysin - 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  ST - 3 </prot>  ) ] expression in groups of de novo ( n = 64 ) and ex adenoma ( n = 42 ) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression .
The rates of extensive <prot>  ST - 3 </prot>  expression and decreased <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  expression were significantly higher in the de novo group ( P = 0.014 and 0.005 , respectively ) .
Histopathologically , the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern .
These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential .
