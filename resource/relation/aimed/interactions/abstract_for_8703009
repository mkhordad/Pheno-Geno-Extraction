TI - Physical interaction of mammalian <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  PG - 22030 - 4 AB - <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of <prot>  CDC28 </prot>  with cyclins .
The exact functional mechanism by which <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  promotes this association , however , remains unknown .
 <prot> CDK4 </prot>  is a <prot>  cyclin D - dependent kinase </prot>  that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle .
We have detected a specific association of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with the molecular chaperon <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  </p2>  and a 44 - kDa protein that we identify as mammalian <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p2>  .
A physical interaction between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  suggests that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  .
Association of <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with both <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  </p2>  may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  and <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  .
