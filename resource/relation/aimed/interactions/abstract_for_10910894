TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 840 - 5 AB - <prot>  Liver - expressed chemokine </prot>  ( <prot>  LEC </prot>  ) is an unusually large CC chemokine , which is also known as <prot>  LMC </prot>  , <prot>  HCC - 4 </prot>  , <prot>  NCC - 4 </prot>  , and <prot>  CCL16 </prot>  .
Previously , <prot>  LEC </prot>  was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized .
We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to and activates <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  </p2>  transfected HEK - 293 cells .
 <prot> LEC </prot>  induced maximal migration of <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  and <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  transfected cells at 89.3 nmol / L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol / L .
The molar concentration of <prot>  LEC </prot>  required to induce maximum cell migration is 20 - to 200 - fold greater than that required for <prot>  RANTES </prot>  or <prot>  I309 </prot>  , respectively .
All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol / L .
A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to <prot>  LEC </prot>  was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of <prot>  LEC </prot>  required to induce chemotaxis was a property of <prot>  LEC </prot>  and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination .
This study suggests that <prot>  LEC </prot>  may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration .
