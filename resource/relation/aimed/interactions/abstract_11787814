TI - Antiapoptotic proteins .
The <prot>  bcl - 2 </prot>  and inhibitor of apoptosis protein families .
AB - The balance between pro - and antiapoptotic proteins can determine cellular fate .
In this regard , the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and IAP protein families have evolved as highly conserved regulators of cell death .
A further testament to their critical roles in maintaining balance between cell life and death may be the increasing implication of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and TAP proteins in the pathologies of human diseases .
Although much has been learned about these families of proteins , future studies of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and IAP families are sure to hold more exciting discoveries and will continue to reveal new strategies for combating human diseases .
