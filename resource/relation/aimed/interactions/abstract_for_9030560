PG - 4985 - 92 AB - Mutagenesis of the <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  ) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  ( <prot>  EPO </prot>  ) binding .
We employed both random and site - specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain ( referred to as <prot>  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding protein </prot>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  ) of the <prot>  EPOR </prot>  .
Residues were chosen for site - specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family .
Site - specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble <prot>  EBP </prot>  and analyzed for <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding in several different assay formats .
In addition , selected mutant proteins were expressed as full - length <prot>  EPOR </prot>  on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I - <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding in receptor binding assays .
Using these methods , we have identified residues that appear to be involved in <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding as well as other residues , most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family , that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and / or stability of the <prot>  EPOR </prot>  .
We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the <prot>  EBP </prot>  with a peptide ligand .
