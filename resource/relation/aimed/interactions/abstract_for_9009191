TI - Competitive binding of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  alpha - actinin </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  calmodulin </prot>  </p1>  to the <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  NMDA receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
PG - 439 - 42 AB - The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown .
The activity of NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of <prot>  actin </prot>  , suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. <prot>  alpha - Actinin - 2 </prot>  , a member of the spectrin / <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  family of <prot>  actin </prot>  - binding proteins , is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor - clustering molecule <prot>  PSD - 95 </prot>  . <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  alpha - Actinin - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both <prot>  NR1 </prot>  and <prot>  NR2B </prot>  subunits of the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  NMDA receptor </prot>  </p2>  , and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  PSD - 95 </prot>  </p2>  from rat brain .
Intriguingly , <prot>  NR1 </prot>  - <prot>  alpha - actinin </prot>  binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+ / <prot>  calmodulin </prot>  .
Thus <prot>  alpha - actinin </prot>  may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+ .
