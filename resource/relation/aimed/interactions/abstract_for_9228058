TI - Characterization of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Apo - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD95 </prot>  </p1>  ) - <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  Fas </prot>  ligand </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  interaction .
PG - 18827 - 33 AB - The death - inducing receptor <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is activated when cross - linked by the type II membrane protein <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p1>  ligand </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) .
When human soluble <prot>  FasL </prot>  ( sFasL , containing the extracellular portion ) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells , the three N - linked glycans of each <prot>  FasL </prot>  monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion .
Based on the structure of the closely related <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin alpha </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  tumor necrosis factor receptor I </prot>  </p2>  complex , a molecular model of the <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  homotrimer bound to three <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  molecules was generated using knowledge - based protein modeling methods .
Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor - ligand interaction were introduced at three sites .
The F275L mutant , mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation , exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to <prot>  Fas </prot>  .
Mutants P206R , P206D , and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward <prot>  Fas </prot>  - positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant <prot>  Fas </prot>  - immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins .
Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered , mutant Y218R was inactive , correlating with the prediction that Tyr - 218 of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p1>  interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  .
Interestingly , mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine , but not human cells .
