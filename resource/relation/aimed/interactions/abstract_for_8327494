TI - Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc - finger transcription factors <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 6145 - 9 AB - Two promoter elements are important for basal - level transcription , the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator ( Inr ) element encompassing the start site .
The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood , partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated .
The recently cloned <prot>  YY1 </prot>  is such an <prot>  Inr - binding protein </prot>  .
 <prot> YY1 </prot>  is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro .
The ability of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  .
To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between <prot>  YY1 </prot>  and <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  , we explored the possibility of protein - protein interactions between these two transcription factors .
We found that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  can form a physical complex .
In addition , we identified domains within <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  that mediate their interactions with each other .
The physical interaction between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously .
