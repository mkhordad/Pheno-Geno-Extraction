TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  interacts with protein phosphatases <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  PP2A </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  PP1 </prot>  </p2>  and disrupts a G2 / M cell - cycle checkpoint .
PG - 454 - 8 AB - <prot>  Hox11 </prot>  is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen .
 <prot> HOX11 </prot>  is also oncogenic , having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T - cell leukaemia .
Transgenic mice that redirected <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  to the thymus demonstrated cell - cycle aberration and progression to malignancy .
We observed that the protein <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interacted with protein <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  serine - threonine phosphatase 2A </prot>  catalytic subunit </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  PP2AC </prot>  </p2>  ) , as well as <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  protein phosphatase 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  PP1C </prot>  </p2>  ) in mammalian cells .
Inhibition of <prot>  PP2A </prot>  can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation - promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes .
Microinjection of <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase .
G2 arrest can be induced by gamma - irradiation , but is eliminated by expression of <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  within a T - cell line .
Thus <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is a cellular oncogene that targets <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  PP2A </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  PP1 </prot>  </p2>  , both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters .
This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle .
