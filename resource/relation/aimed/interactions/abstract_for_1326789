TI - Activation of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  mitogen - activated protein kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  </p1>  by <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  v - Raf </prot>  </p2>  in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro .
PG - 1404 - 7 AB - Mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases are 42 - and 44 - kD serine - threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors .
 <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> MAP kinase </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and the protein kinase that activates it ( <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  MAP kinase kinase </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms ( p35EC12 , p3722W ) of the <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  protein kinase .
The <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  v - Raf </prot>  </p1>  proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  </p2>  from skeletal muscle in vitro .
Furthermore , a bacterially expressed <prot>  v - Raf </prot>  fusion protein ( glutathione S - transferase - p3722W ) also activated <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  in vitro .
These findings suggest that one function of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  </p2>  .
