TI - cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF .
PG - 197 - 208 AB - We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone , <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  , encoding a human fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor. <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin - like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain .
Transient expression in COS - 1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C - terminal peptide , gave rise to two components , representing mature ( 130 kDa ) and precursor ( 115 kDa ) forms of the <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  encoded polypeptide , which was denoted <prot>  hFGFR - 1 </prot>  .
Crosslinking of iodinated <prot>  acidic FGF </prot>  ( <prot>  aFGF </prot>  ) and <prot>  basic FGF </prot>  ( <prot>  bFGF </prot>  ) to transiently expressing COS - 1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa , which was competed for by both <prot>  aFGF </prot>  and <prot>  bFGF </prot>  .
From Scatchard analyses , the Kd :s for binding of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  aFGF </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  bFGF </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hFGFR - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM , respectively .
Thus , <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  aFGF </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  bFGF </prot>  </p2>  .
