TI - Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin .
PG - 6807 - 16 AB - The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi - angle laser light scattering .
Native <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free - energy change DeltaG degrees of - 8.3 kcal / mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 AMPPPP mgr ; M ( at 20 degrees C ) that was ionic strength - and temperature - dependent .
A va n't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = - 12.9 kcal / mol and DeltaS degrees = - 15.9 cal mol - 1 deg - 1 , suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  .
Native <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  also formed a heterodimer with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  C5 </prot>  </p2>  and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction .
Suramin induced high - affinity trimerization of <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C ) and dimerization of <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C ) .
Suramin - induced <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug 's ability to prevent complement - mediated hemolysis .
Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin - binding sites on each <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and three on each <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  in the oligomers .
Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations , but 8 - aminonaphthalene - 1 , 3 , 6 - trisulfonate ( ANTS2 - ) , which mimics half a suramin molecule , could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins .
