TI - A <prot>  lymphotoxin - beta </prot>  - specific receptor .
PG - 707 - 10 AB - Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and <prot>  lymphotoxin - alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  ) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses .
The cell surface form of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin - beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  </p2>  ) , a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family .
Secreted <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons ; however , these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  </p2>  complex .
A receptor specific for human <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  was identified , which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  .
