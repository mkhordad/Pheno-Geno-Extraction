TI - Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human <prot>  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family .
PG - 14045 - 54 AB - The <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  ) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains .
We have used site - specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  to search for amino acid residues involved in <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  ) binding .
Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding proteins ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  ) and characterized for <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding activity in a number of different assays .
Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 ( Phe93 ) with alanine ( F93A mutation ) resulted in a drastic reduction in <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding in the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  .
More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding .
Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the <prot>  EBP </prot>  .
Furthermore , the F93A mutation in full - length <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p1>  expressed in COS cells abolished detectable <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  binding .
This was not a result of processing or transport defects , since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells .
Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding .
These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding determinant of the <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family , these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands .
