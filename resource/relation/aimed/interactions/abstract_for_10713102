TI - <prot>  TrkA </prot>  amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor .
PG - 7870 - 7 AB - Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system , mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family .
The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine - rich motif , a leucine - rich motif , a second cysteine - rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin - like domains .
Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin - binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin - like domain .
Although the individual amino acids in <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  TrkA </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  involved in binding to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  nerve growth factor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  NGF </prot>  </p2>  ) and those in <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TrkC </prot>  </p1>  involved in binding to <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  neurotrophin - 3 </prot>  </p2>  have been mapped in this domain , the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear .
In this study , a minimum set of residues in the human <prot>  TrkC </prot>  second immunoglobulin - like domain , which does not bind <prot>  nerve growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  NGF </prot>  ) , were substituted with those from human <prot>  TrkA </prot>  .
The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  NGF </prot>  </p1>  equivalent to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  TrkA </prot>  </p2>  , maintained <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  neurotrophin - 3 </prot>  </p1>  binding equivalent to <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TrkC </prot>  </p2>  , and also bound <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophin </prot>  </p1>  , although with lower affinity compared with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TrkB </prot>  </p2>  .
This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin - like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk .
