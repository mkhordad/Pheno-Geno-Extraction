TI - Proto - oncoprotein <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p1>  interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells .
PG - 70 - 6 AB - The molecular adapter <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the <prot>  TCR </prot>  and associates with <prot>  Src </prot>  homology domain - 2 ( SH2 ) / SH3 domain - containing adapters such as <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Crk </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Crk - L </prot>  </p2>  , which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family .
This suggests that <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  may link <prot>  TCR </prot>  activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins .
The SH2 / SH3 - containing protein <prot>  Vav </prot>  also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain , and <prot>  Vav </prot>  has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the <prot>  TCR </prot>  .
Here we show that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  form inducible molecular complexes in <prot>  TCR </prot>  - activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate - treated T cells .
 <p1  pair=6 >  <prot> Vav </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene - targeted mice that lack the T cell - specific inhibitory receptor <prot>  CTLA - 4 </prot>  , in which <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues .
The interaction between <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of <prot>  Vav </prot>  and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  .
In addition , we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  is the binding site for the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p2>  SH2 domain in vitro .
These data imply that <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of <prot>  Vav </prot>  in thymocytes and peripheral T cells .
