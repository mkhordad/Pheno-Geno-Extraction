TI - Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor .
PG - 16491 - 4 AB - Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis , degranulate , and exhibit [ C2+ ] i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein <prot>  ( MIP ) - 1 alpha </prot>  , regulated on activation , normal T expressed and secreted ( <prot>  RANTES </prot>  ) , and <prot>  monocyte chemoattractant protein - 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  ) , but the receptors involved have not been defined .
We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil - selective chemokine receptor , designated <prot>  CC chemokine receptor 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  ) .
 <prot> CC CKR3 </prot>  is a seven - transmembrane domain G protein - coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte - and neutrophil - selective receptor <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  ( also known as the <prot>  MIP - 1 alpha </prot>  / <prot>  RANTES </prot>  receptor ) .
When [ Ca2+ ] i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells , <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ( MIP ) - 1 alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  <prot>  MIP </prot>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RANTES </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  were both potent agonists for <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
However , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  MIP - 1 beta </prot>  </p1>  was also an agonist for <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  ; <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  was an agonist for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  .
 <prot> CC CKR3 </prot>  may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation .
