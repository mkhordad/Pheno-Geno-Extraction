TI - <prot>  BMP - 4 </prot>  and <prot>  BMP - 6 </prot>  involvement in the osteogenic properties of the HeLa cell line .
AB - The heterotopically induced ossicles are used in our research on bone tissue .
The ossicles are formed in the thigh muscle of BALB / c mice under the influence of injected suspension of 3 x 10 ( 6 ) HeLa cells .
We postulate that the mechanism of bone induction is based on the secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins <prot>  BMP - 4 </prot>  and <prot>  BMP - 6 </prot>  by the grafted HeLa cells .
This was proved by the use of specific immunohistochemical reaction and Western blots of conditioned culture medium .
It seems that HeLa cells secrete BMPs continuously into the culture medium , even without contact with the mice muscle tissue , were induction of bone tissue is observed .
