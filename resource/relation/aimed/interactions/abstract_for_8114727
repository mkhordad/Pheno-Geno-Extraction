TI - Characterization of a novel 23 - kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes .
PG - 1956 - 63 AB - Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  , <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  , and three additional proteins , <prot>  p54 </prot>  , <prot>  p50 </prot>  , and <prot>  p23 </prot>  .
 <prot> p23 </prot>  is also present in immunoaffinity - purified <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  complexes along with <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  and another protein , <prot>  p60 </prot>  .
Antibody and cDNA probes for <prot>  p23 </prot>  were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein .
Antibodies to <prot>  p23 </prot>  detect similar levels of <prot>  p23 </prot>  in all tissues tested and cross - react with a protein of the same size in mice , rabbits , guinea pigs , humans , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , indicating that <prot>  p23 </prot>  is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution .
These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library , resulting in the isolation of a 468 - bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken <prot>  p23 </prot>  .
This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full - length human cDNA clone .
The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins .
The chicken and human cDNAs are 88 % identical at the DNA level and 96.3 % identical at the protein level .
 <prot> p23 </prot>  is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid - rich carboxy - terminal domain .
Bacterially overexpressed human <prot>  p23 </prot>  was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to <prot>  p23 </prot>  .
These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  p23 </prot>  </p1>  in complex with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol .
