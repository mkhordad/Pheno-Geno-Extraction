TI - Cloning and functional analysis of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  </p1>  : a novel <prot>  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  - binding protein </prot>  with anti - cell death activity .
PG - 279 - 84 AB - Using a protein interaction cloning technique , we identified cDNAs that encode a novel <prot>  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  - binding protein </prot>  , termed <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
The <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  protein shares no significant homology with <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  or other <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins , which can form homo - and heterodimers .
In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line , Jurkat , coexpression of <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli , including staurosporine , anti - Fas antibody , and cytolytic T cells , relative to cells that contained gene transfer - mediated elevations in either <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  or <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein alone .
 <prot> BAG </prot>  - transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus .
The findings indicate that bag - 1 represents a new type of anti - cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  .
