TI - Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  bound to DNA .
PG - 257 - 61 AB - The <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Jun </prot>  </p2>  families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form complexes capable of binding 5 ' - TGAGTCA - 3 ' DNA elements .
We have determined the X - ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP regions of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  bound to DNA .
Both subunits form continuous alpha - helices .
The carboxy - terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled - coil , and the amino - terminal regions make base - specific contacts with DNA in the major groove .
Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein - DNA complexes show that the coiled - coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fos </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Jun </prot>  </p2>  heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5 ' - TGAGTCA - 3 ' recognition element in a unique orientation .
There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled - coil , consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers .
