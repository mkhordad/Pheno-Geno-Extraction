TI - A direct interaction between <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  G - protein beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  subunits and the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 protein kinase </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 14251 - 4 AB - <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is a serine / threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of <prot>  Ras </prot>  in the <prot>  mitogen - activated protein kinase </prot>  cascade .
Using a yeast two - hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl - terminal half of the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  G beta 2 subunit </prot>  </p2>  of heterotrimeric G - proteins .
In vitro , purified <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1 - 330 of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST - <prot>  Raf </prot>  indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  .
In competition experiments , the carboxyl terminus of <prot>  beta - adrenergic receptor kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  beta ARK </prot>  ) blocked the binding of <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p2>  ; however , the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  - binding proteins , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p2>  and 14 - 3 - 3 , had no effect .
Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p2>  revealed an affinity of interaction ( Kd = 163 + / - 36 nM ) , similar to that seen between <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  beta ARK </prot>  </p2>  ( Kd = 87 + / - 24 nM ) .
The formation of native heterotrimeric <prot>  G alpha beta gamma </prot>  complexes , as measured by pertussis toxin ADP - ribosylation of G alpha , could be disrupted by increasing amounts of <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  , with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM , in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity .
In vivo complexes of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p2>  were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293 - T cells transfected with epitope - tagged <prot>  G beta 2 </prot>  .
The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross - talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G - proteins .
