TI - 14 - 3 - 3 proteins associate with <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  phosphatases .
PG - 7892 - 6 AB - The <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin - dependent kinases .
Two members of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two - hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases .
Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14 - 3 - 3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14 - 3 - 3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening .
14 - 3 - 3 proteins constitute a family of well - conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction .
We present evidence that indicates that <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo .
14 - 3 - 3 protein does not , however , affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , which is known to bind 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , has recently been shown to associate with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  </p2>  and to stimulate its phosphatase activity .
14 - 3 - 3 protein , however , has no effect on the <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  - kinase activity of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .
Instead , 14 - 3 - 3 may facilitate the association of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  in vivo , participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery .
