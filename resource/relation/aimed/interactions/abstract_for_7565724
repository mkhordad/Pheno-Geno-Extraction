TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein </prot>  </p1>  physically associates with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Nck </prot>  </p2>  through Src homology 3 domains .
PG - 5725 - 31 AB - In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify <prot>  p47nck </prot>  - Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) - binding molecules , we report the cloning of <prot>  SAKAP II </prot>  ( <prot>  Src A box Nck - associated protein II </prot>  ) from an HL60 cDNA expression library .
This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of <prot>  WASP </prot>  , which is mutated in Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome patients .
Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  p47nck </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , anti - <prot>  Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein </prot>  antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis .
In vitro translation studies identified the 66 - kDa protein as the protein product of <prot>  WASP </prot>  , and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that <prot>  p66WASP </prot>  is mainly present in the cytosol fraction , although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions .
The main <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  p47nck </prot>  </p1>  region implicated in the association with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  p66WASP </prot>  </p2>  was found to be the carboxy - terminal SH3 domain .
