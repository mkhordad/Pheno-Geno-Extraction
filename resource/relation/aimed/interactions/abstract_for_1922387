TI - Phosphorylation of <prot>  c - jun </prot>  mediated by MAP kinases .
PG - 670 - 4 AB - The proto - oncogene <prot>  c - jun </prot>  is a component of the <prot>  AP - 1 </prot>  transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli .
The <prot>  c - jun </prot>  protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters .
Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens , phorbol esters and activated <prot>  ras </prot>  .
We present evidence that <prot>  mitogen - activated protein - serine ( MAP ) kinases </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  pp54 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  pp42 </prot>  </p1>  / 44 ) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  c - jun </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
The <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  enzymes <prot>  pp54 </prot>  and <prot>  pp42 </prot>  / 44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine / threonine phosphorylation .
 <prot> MAP kinase </prot>  activation of <prot>  c - jun </prot>  may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens , growth factors and oncogenes .
