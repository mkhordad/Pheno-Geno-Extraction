TI - The rates of commitment to renaturation of <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  and <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  in the presence of the groE chaperonins .
PG - 29598 - 601 AB - Current models of chaperonin - assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state .
Using immunoprecipitation techniques , we have determined the rates at which <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  GS </prot>  </p1>  ) are released from <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  in a form committed to refold to active enzyme .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <prot> Rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  </p1>  were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable AMPPPP quot ; folding arrested AMPPPP quot ; complexes with <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
At various times during the groE - dependent renaturations , <prot>  groEL </prot>  was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation ( 30 s ) .
The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h .
At 25 degrees C , the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of <prot>  GS </prot>  to its native state occurs far earlier ( t1 / 2 LTTTTT 1 min ) than for <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  ( t1 / 2 = 5 min ) .
In light of previous results , it appears that <prot>  GS </prot>  monomers can attain a groE - independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin .
In contrast , the renaturation rate for <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following <prot>  groEL </prot>  depletion .
This suggests that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  must interact with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent ( groE independent ) state .
If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct , <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does <prot>  GS </prot>  .
Structurally , the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature , number , and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins .
