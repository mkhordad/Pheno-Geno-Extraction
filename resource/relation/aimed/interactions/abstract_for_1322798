TI - The SH2 and SH3 domain - containing protein <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling .
PG - 431 - 42 AB - A cDNA clone encoding a novel , widely expressed protein ( called <prot>  growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 </prot>  or <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  ) containing one src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated .
Immunoblotting experiments indicate that <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  associates with tyrosine - phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) and platelet - derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFRs ) via its SH2 domain .
Interestingly , <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem - 5 .
It has been shown that sem - 5 and two other genes called let - 23 ( EGFR like ) and let - 60 ( ras like ) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction .
To examine whether <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells , microinjection studies were performed .
While injection of <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  or <prot>  H - ras </prot>  proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect , microinjection of <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  together with <prot>  H - ras </prot>  protein stimulated DNA synthesis .
These results suggest that <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  / <prot>  sem - 5 </prot>  plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling .
