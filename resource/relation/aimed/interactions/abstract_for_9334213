TI - A region of the beta subunit of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  interferon alpha </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  different from box 1 interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  </p2>  and is sufficient to activate the <prot>  Jak </prot>  - Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state .
PG - 26388 - 93 AB - Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human <prot>  <prot>  interferon alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  ) receptor </prot>  is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  .
To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  signaling , we coexpressed wild - type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L - 929 cells .
Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids ( AAs ) ( AAs 265 - 346 ) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the <prot>  Jak </prot>  - Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after <prot>  IFNalpha2 </prot>  binding to the receptor .
This region of the betaL chain , required for <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  binding and activation , contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with <prot>  Jak </prot>  kinases .
However , using glutathione S - transferase fusion proteins containing amino - and carboxyl - terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain , we demonstrate that the main <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  - binding region ( corresponding to AAs 300 - 346 on the beta subunit ) is distinct from the Box 1 domain ( AAs 287 - 295 ) .
