TI - Cloning of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  TRAP </prot>  </p1>  , a ligand for <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD40 </prot>  </p2>  on human T cells .
PG - 3191 - 4 AB - A cDNA clone , designated <prot>  TRAP </prot>  ( <prot>  TNF - related activation protein </prot>  ) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes .
The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx .
2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M ( r ) of 29.3 kDa .
The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein , but are also compatible with a secreted form .
 <prot> TRAP </prot>  is highly similar to an identified murine <prot>  CD40 ligand </prot>  both at the cDNA ( 82.8 % identity ) and the protein ( 77.4 % identity ) levels , and related to tumor necrosis factor / <prot>  lymphotoxin </prot>  .
Expressed in a murine myeloma , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TRAP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  was identified as a ligand for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD40 </prot>  </p2>  by binding to a soluble <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD40 </prot>  </p2>  construct .
 <prot> TRAP </prot>  mRNA is expressed in a T cell - specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation .
The <prot>  TRAP </prot>  gene is located in the q26.3 - q27.1 region of the X chromosome .
