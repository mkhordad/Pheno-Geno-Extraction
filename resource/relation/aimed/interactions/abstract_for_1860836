TI - Interaction of the regulatory subunit ( <prot>  RII </prot>  ) of <prot>  cAMP - dependent protein kinase </prot>  with <prot>  RII </prot>  - anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif .
PG - 14188 - 92 AB - The <prot>  type II cAMP - dependent protein kinase </prot>  is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) dimer to <prot>  RII </prot>  - anchoring proteins .
Computer - aided analysis of secondary structure , performed on four <prot>  RII </prot>  - anchoring protein sequences ( the <prot>  microtubule - associated protein 2 </prot>  , <prot>  P150 </prot>  , and two thyroid proteins <prot>  Ht 21 </prot>  and <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  ) , has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices .
The potential amphipathic helix region of <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  ( Leu - Ile - Glu - Glu - Ala - Ala - Ser - Arg - Ile - Val - Asp - Ala - Val - Ile ) lies between residues 494 and 507 .
A bacterially expressed 318 - amino acid fragment , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  </p1>  ( 418 - 736 ) , containing the amphipathic helix region , was able to bind <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  </p2>  .
Site - directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically .
Specifically , substitution of proline for Ala - 498 significantly diminished <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  binding , and similar mutation of Ile - 502 or Ile - 507 abolished interaction .
Mutation of Ala - 522 to proline , which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region , had no effect on <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  binding .
These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  via an amphipathic helix binding motif .
