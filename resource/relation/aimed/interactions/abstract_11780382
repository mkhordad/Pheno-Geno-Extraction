TI - Th1 / Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines and the effect of <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  therapy .
METHODS : Th1 / Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  .
RESULTS : Levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls ( P = 0.07 ) .
However , the levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  were higher than those of controls ( P = 0.01 ) .
Cytokines measurements during <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  at 4 , 12 , and 24 weeks .
Levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  were slightly increased following <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment ( P = 0.09 ) .
In patients with a complete response to <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  , the levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  were higher at 24 weeks following <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment than that of pre - treatment ( P = 0.04 ) , and the levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks ( P = 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively ) . mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant .
CONCLUSION : The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B .
 <prot> Interferon - alpha </prot>  therapy can modulate the balance of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines , and this is related to its clinical effect .
Levels of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during <prot>  Interferon - alpha </prot>  treatment .
