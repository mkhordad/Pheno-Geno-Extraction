TI - Characterization of the <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  - syntrophin interaction using the two - hybrid system in yeast .
PG - 124 - 8 AB - The carboxy - terminal region of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p1>  has previously been shown to interact directly with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  alpha1 syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  , a cytoplasmic component of the <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  - glycoprotein complex , by in vitro biochemical studies such as overlay assay or immunoprecipitation .
Using the two - hybrid system , we have isolated from a human heart cDNA library the entire coding sequence of human <prot>  alpha1 syntrophin </prot>  , therefore confirming for the first time this interaction via an in vivo approach .
In addition , we have reduced the interaction domain to the distal half of <prot>  alpha1 syntrophin </prot>  .
