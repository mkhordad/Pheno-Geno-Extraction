TI - <prot>  Hepatitis B virus X protein </prot>  is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with <prot>  transcription factor IIB </prot>  and the <prot>  RNA polymerase II subunit 5 </prot>  .
PG - 7132 - 9 AB - <prot>  Hepatitis B virus X protei </prot>  n ( <prot>  HBx </prot>  ) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis - elements .
However , the mechanism is still obscure .
Our finding that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  directly interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RNA polymerase II subunit 5 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  ) , a common subunit of RNA polymerases , implies that <prot>  HBx </prot>  directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase ( Cheong , J. H. , Yi , M. , Lin , Y. , and Murakami , S. ( 1995 ) EMBO J. 14 , 142 - 150 ) .
In this context , we examined the possibility that <prot>  HBx </prot>  and <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  interact with other general transcription factors .
 <prot> HBx </prot>  and <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  specifically bound to <prot>  transcription factor IIB </prot>  ( <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  ) in vitro , both of which were detected by either far - Western blotting or the glutathione S - transferase - resin pull - down assay .
Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  , and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  each has two binding regions for the other two proteins .
Co - immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express <prot>  HBx </prot>  demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo .
Some <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  substitution mutants , which had severely impaired transacting activity , exhibited reduced binding affinity with either <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  in a mutually exclusive manner , suggesting that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  transactivation requires the interactions of both <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  .
These results indicated that <prot>  HBx </prot>  is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  through communication with <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  .
