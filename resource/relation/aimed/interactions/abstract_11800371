TI - Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and <prot>  cyclooxygenase - 2 </prot>  in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients .
AB - Glucocorticoid treatment has been widely used to suppress inflammatory and immune responses .
However , from a clinical point of view , its efficacy in the treatment of nasal polyposis seems to vary individually from patient to patient .
In the present study , we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs ) and <prot>  cyclooxygenase - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  ) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls .
Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of both GR messenger RNA and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  messenger RNA expression in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients , as well as in normal nasal mucosa from controls .
Consistent with this finding , immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRs and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  were labeled in both tissues .
In nasal polyps , GR labeling was associated with the cytoplasm and nucleus of surface mucosa , submucosal glands , endothelial cells , and inflammatory cells .
Importantly , <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of surface mucosa , submucosal glands , and the vascular wall in nasal polyps .
In contrast , in normal nasal tissues , <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  labeling was only found in the vascular wall , and the expression was weaker -- a finding demonstrating that <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  is upregulated in nasal polyps .
Therefore , 1 ) the presence of GRs and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients , as well as upregulation of <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  expression , suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps ; and 2 ) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.
