TI - Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors in human myocardial trabeculae .
AB - The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle .
Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths , and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied .
 <prot> Endothelin - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  ET - 1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  ET - 3 </prot>  had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae .
 <prot> ET - 1 </prot>  was significantly more potent than <prot>  ET - 3 </prot>  in both atrial ( P LTTTTT 0.001 ) and ventricular ( P LTTTTT 0.05 ) trabeculae .
Preincubation with the <prot>  ET ( A ) receptor </prot>  antagonist FR139317 ( 1 microM ) decreased significantly ( P LTTTTT 0.005 ) the potency of <prot>  ET - I </prot>  in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae , without any significant changes in Emax ( maximum effect obtained with an agonist ) .
The <prot>  ET ( B ) receptor </prot>  agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae , and the <prot>  ET ( B ) receptor </prot>  antagonist BQ 788 ( 1 microM ) almost completely blocked this effect .
These results suggest that both <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart .
