TI - The genetics of host resistance and susceptibility to tuberculosis .
AB - The study of human genomics has the potential to aid our understanding of the interindividual and interpopulation differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis .
Resistance to infection is affected by the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and destroy the bacilli .
Several genes are involved in this process , and two have been the focus of recent interest : the <prot>  natural resistance - associated protein </prot>  ( <prot>  NRAMP1 </prot>  ) gene and the genes coding for the <prot>  vitamin D receptor </prot>  .
Susceptibility genes have also been discovered -- for example , one on the X chromosome that may explain the increased susceptibility of males to tuberculosis .
Studies have also focused on the variations in virulence of the bacillus in both its drug - susceptible and drug - resistant forms .
These mechanisms must be understood in order to prevent , or combat , the emergence of a virulent , multidrug - resistant form of the bacillus that would be uncontrollable by means of today 's treatment strategies .
