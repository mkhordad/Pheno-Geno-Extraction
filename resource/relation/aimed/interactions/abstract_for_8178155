TI - Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the <prot>  interleukin - 2 receptor </prot>  .
PG - 965 - 8 AB - A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes , and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated .
The cytokine , designated <prot>  interleukin - 15 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  ) , is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  .
Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor inhibited the biological activity of <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  , and <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  competed for binding with <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  , indicating that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  </p1>  uses components of the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
