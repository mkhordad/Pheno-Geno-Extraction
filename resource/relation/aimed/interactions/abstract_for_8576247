TI - The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues , have distinct chromosomal locations , and each bind to <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  and its relatives .
PG - 2724 - 30 AB - The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58 - kDa intracellular membrane - associated <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  - binding proteins .
We have cloned and characterized human <prot>  acidic ( alpha 1 - ) syntrophin </prot>  and a second isoform of human <prot>  basic ( beta 2 - ) syntrophin </prot>  .
Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin ( together with the previously reported human <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  ) demonstrates their overall similarity .
The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1 - and <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse , suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms , Much like <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  , human <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely , although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance .
In contrast , human <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle , and less so in other tissues .
Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations : <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  to chromosome 16q22 - 23 and <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  to chromosome 20q11.2 .
Finally , we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that , like <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  , both beta 2 - and <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin - binding region of <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  utrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  related protein </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , and the <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Torpedo 87K protein </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
