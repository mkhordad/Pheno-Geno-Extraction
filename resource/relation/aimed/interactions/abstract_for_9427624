TI - <prot>  TAP </prot>  - and <prot>  tapasin </prot>  - dependent <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide .
PG - 1 - 10 AB - BACKGROUND : The human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class lb molecule <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell .
We have recently shown that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  binds signal - sequence - derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro .
RESULTS : Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA - E , we show that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is expressed at the cell surface .
We demonstrate that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  .
Further studies on the interaction of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with the <p2  pair=1 >  transporter associated with antigen processing </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TAP </prot>  </p2>  ) and <p2  pair=3 >  calreticulin </p2>  , and that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  expression is <prot>  TAP </prot>  - dependent and tapasin - dependent .
In addition , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  </p1>  dissociates from <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  TAP </prot>  </p2>  upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides .
CONCLUSION : These experiments establish that surface expression of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules .
The correlation between <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  .
Our results also show that , although these <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  binding peptides are derived from signal sequences , they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the <prot>  TAP </prot>  complex and loaded onto <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  molecules .
