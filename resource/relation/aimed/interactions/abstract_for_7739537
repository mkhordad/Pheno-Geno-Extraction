TI - In vivo association of <prot>  E2F </prot>  and DP family proteins .
PG - 2536 - 46 AB - The mammalian transcription factor <prot>  E2F </prot>  plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle .
This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the <prot>  retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein </prot>  ( <prot>  pRB </prot>  ) or its relatives <prot>  p107 </prot>  and <prot>  p103 </prot>  .
The first cDNA from the <prot>  E2F </prot>  family to be cloned was designated <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  , and multiple <prot>  E2F </prot>  family members have now been identified .
They bind to DNA as heterodimers , interacting with proteins known as DP .
Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members ( <prot>  hDP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  hDP - 2 </prot>  ) .
Both <prot>  hDP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  hDP - 2 </prot>  bind to all <prot>  E2F </prot>  family members in vivo , and each complex is capable of activating transcription .
However , the various <prot>  E2F </prot>  / DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either <prot>  pRB </prot>  or <prot>  p107 </prot>  in vivo , and the specificity of <prot>  pRB </prot>  or <prot>  p107 </prot>  binding is mediated by the <prot>  E2F </prot>  subunit .
