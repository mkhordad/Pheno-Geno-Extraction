TI - A <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components .
PG - 46 - 50 AB - The protein product of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  proto - oncogene is known to interact with several proteins , including <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Crk </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PI3 kinase </prot>  </p2>  , and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors .
The precise function of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  in these pathways is not clear , although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  is a negative regulator of the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  epidermal growth factor </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction .
The screen identified interactions involving <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and two 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  cytokeratin 18 </prot>  </p2>  , human unconventional myosin IC , and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  SH3 P17 </prot>  </p2>  .
We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  required for its interaction with each of the proteins .
Interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts .
