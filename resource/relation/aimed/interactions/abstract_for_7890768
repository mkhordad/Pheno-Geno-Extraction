TI - <prot>  Inhibin </prot>  antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant - negative mechanism .
PG - 6308 - 13 AB - The beta : <prot>  beta activin </prot>  homodimer and alpha : <prot>  beta inhibin </prot>  heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit .
Recently , it has been shown that , similar to <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta 1 </prot>  , activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis .
The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine / threonine kinases .
Activin type I receptors , <prot>  SKR1 </prot>  and <prot>  SKR2 </prot>  , were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells ( HepG2 ) .
This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis .
Here we show that beta : <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  beta activin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  activin type II receptor kinase </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p2>  ) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase <prot>  SKR2 </prot>  to form <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p1>  .beta :beta .
 <p2  pair=4 >  <prot> SKR2 </prot>  </p2>  complexes in which an <prot>  activin beta </prot>  chain occupies each receptor subunit .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> Inhibin </prot>  </p1>  also binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p2>  through its beta subunit , competes with the binding of activin to <prot>  ActRII </prot>  , but fails to form the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p1>  .
 <p2  pair=5 >  <prot> SKR2 </prot>  </p2>  complex .
No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells .
 <prot> Inhibin </prot>  , which had no activity of its own , antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis .
The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric <prot>  activin receptor </prot>  complex through a dominant - negative mechanism .
