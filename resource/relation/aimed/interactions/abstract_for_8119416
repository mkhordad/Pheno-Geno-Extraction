TI - Cloning of the complete coding region for human <prot>  protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 </prot>  using the two hybrid system and expression of <prot>  inhibitor 2 </prot>  in E. coli .
PG - 93 - 8 AB - The yeast two hybrid system has been employed to identify cDNAs encoding proteins which interact with the gamma 1 isoform of human <prot>  protein phosphatase 1 </prot>  .
Here we report the isolation of cDNA encoding human <prot>  protein phosphatase inhibitor </prot>  .
The deduced human sequence of 205 amino acids shows 92 % identity to <prot>  inhibitor 2 </prot>  from rabbit .
Human <prot>  inhibitor 2 </prot>  was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity .
The expressed human protein inhibited both native and bacterially expressed PP1 , with the same Ki ( 1 nM ) as <prot>  inhibitor 2 </prot>  purified from skeletal muscle .
A gene or pseudogene for <prot>  inhibitor 2 </prot>  may be present near the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6 .
