TI - Presenilins interact with <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  , a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport .
PG - 1263 - 9 AB - <prot>  Presenilin 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PS1 </prot>  ) mutations account for the majority of early - onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer 's disease .
Presenilins ( PSs ) are located in many intra - cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , nuclear region and vesicular structures .
These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains , with the N - and C - terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm .
We report an interaction between the human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  or <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PS2 </prot>  </p1>  hydrophilic loop and <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , a small GTPase belonging to the Ras - related superfamily .
Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374 - 400 for <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  and to codons 106 - 179 for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  </p2>  , a region including the fourth GTP - binding domain .
Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways , the PS - <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  interaction suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing .
