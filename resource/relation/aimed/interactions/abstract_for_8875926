TI - Structure of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 1001 - 5 AB - Mutations in the <prot>  p53 </prot>  tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200 - amino acid core domain of the protein .
The core domain contains the sequence - specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p1>  protein binding activity of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  .
The crystal structure of the <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  core domain bound to the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p2>  protein , which contains an SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) domain and four ankyrin repeats , revealed that ( i ) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of <prot>  p53 </prot>  in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3 - polyproline peptide complexes , and ( ii ) an ankyrin repeat , which forms an L - shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices , binds the L2 loop of <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
The structure of the complex shows that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p1>  binding site on the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding .
The six most frequently observed <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  mutations disrupt <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p2>  binding in vitro .
The structure provides evidence that the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the <prot>  p53 </prot>  pathway of tumor suppression .
