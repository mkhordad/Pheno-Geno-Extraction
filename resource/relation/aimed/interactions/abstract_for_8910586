TI - cDNA cloning and characterization of the human <prot>  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin 13 </prot>  receptor </prot>  alpha chain </prot>  .
PG - 29265 - 70 AB - We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human <prot>  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin 13 </prot>  receptor </prot>  alpha chain </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  ) .
The protein has 76 % homology to murine <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  , with 95 % amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain .
Only weak <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  </p1>  binding activity was found in cells transfected with only <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  </p2>  ; however , the combination of both <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 4Ralpha </prot>  resulted in substantial binding activity , with a Kd of approximately 400 pM , indicating that both chains are essential components of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Whereas <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  </p1>  serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common <prot>  cytokine receptor gamma chain </prot>  ( <prot>  gammac </prot>  ) for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  </p2>  signaling , it could not replace the function of <prot>  gammac </prot>  in allowing enhanced <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  binding activity .
Nevertheless , the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  and <prot>  gammac </prot>  are similar , and like <prot>  gammac </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  is located on chromosome X .
