TI - Regulation of the <prot>  Ets </prot>  - related transcription factor <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  by binding to the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  </p2>  protein .
PG - 1330 - 5 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression .
 <prot> Elf - 1 </prot>  is a lymphoid - specific <prot>  Ets </prot>  transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation .
In this report , it is demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the <prot>  Rb </prot>  binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  both in vitro and in vivo .
 <prot> Elf - 1 </prot>  binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  and fails to bind to <prot>  Rb </prot>  mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma .
Co - immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  in resting normal human T cells .
After T cell activation , the phosphorylation of <prot>  Rb </prot>  results in the release of <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  , which is correlated temporally with the activation of <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Overexpression of a phosphorylation - defective form of <prot>  Rb </prot>  inhibited <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  - dependent transcription during T cell activation .
These results demonstrate that <prot>  Rb </prot>  interacts specifically with a lineage - restricted <prot>  Ets </prot>  transcription factor .
This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage - specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells .
