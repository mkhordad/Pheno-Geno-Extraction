TI - Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
PG - 4273 - 7 AB - Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors ( TRs ) are ligand - dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth , differentiation , and development .
The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear .
One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects .
In this study , we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
 <prot> p53 </prot>  is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence - specific DNA binding and / or direct protein - protein interaction .
We found that the human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  TR subtype beta 1 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p1>  ) physically interacted with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  via its DNA binding domain .
As a result of this physical interaction , binding of <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  retinoic X receptor </prot>  </p2>  was inhibited by <prot>  p53 </prot>  in a concentration - dependent manner .
In transfected cells , wild - type <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  repressed the hormone - dependent transcriptional activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
In contrast , mutant <prot>  p53 </prot>  either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  depending on the type of hormone response elements .
These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by <prot>  p53 </prot>  , suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells .
