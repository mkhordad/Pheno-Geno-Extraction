TI - Interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  transthyretin </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  amyloid beta - protein </prot>  </p2>  : binding and inhibition of amyloid formation .
PG - 146 - 60 ; discussion 160 - 4 AB - Aggregated <prot>  amyloid beta - protein </prot>  ( <prot>  A beta </prot>  ) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease .
In contrast , in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , <prot>  A beta </prot>  is found in a soluble form .
The analysis of complexes of <prot>  A beta </prot>  with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of <prot>  A beta </prot>  only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles .
 <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Transthyretin </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  ) , a second major CSF protein , formed SDS - stable complexes with <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and significantly decreased the rate of <prot>  A beta </prot>  fibril formation .
In physiological buffers and CSF , <prot>  TTR </prot>  exclusively decreased the level of <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  pentamers .
Endogenous <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation .
Using site - directed mutagenesis and computer - assisted modelling , we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  monomer that interact with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  .
Specific <prot>  TTR </prot>  immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain .
We propose that <prot>  A beta </prot>  binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of <prot>  A beta </prot>  aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain .
