TI - Crystal structure of human <prot>  platelet - derived growth factor BB </prot>  .
PG - 3921 - 6 AB - The crystal structure of the homodimeric <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BB isoform of human recombinant platelet - derived growth factor </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  PDGF - BB </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) has been determined by X - ray analysis to 3.0 A resolution .
The polypeptide chain is folded into two highly twisted antiparallel pairs of beta - strands and contains an unusual knotted arrangement of three intramolecular disulfide bonds .
Dimerization leads to the clustering of three surface loops at each end of the elongated dimer , which most probably form the receptor recognition sites .
