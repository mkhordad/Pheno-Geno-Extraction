TI - TNF - dependent recruitment of the protein kinase <prot>  RIP </prot>  to the <prot>  TNF receptor - 1 </prot>  signaling complex .
PG - 387 - 96 AB - The death domain of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor - 1 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  </p1>  ) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation through its interaction with the death domain protein <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TRADD </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
Here , we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TRADD </prot>  </p1>  interacts strongly with <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RIP </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  , another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  antigen .
We also show that <prot>  RIP </prot>  is a serine - threonine kinase that is recruited by <prot>  TRADD </prot>  to <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  in a TNF - dependent process .
Overexpression of the intact <prot>  RIP </prot>  protein induces both <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation and apoptosis .
However , expression of the death domain of <prot>  RIP </prot>  Induces apoptosis , but potently inhibits <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation by TNF .
These results suggest that distinct domains of <prot>  RIP </prot>  participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation .
