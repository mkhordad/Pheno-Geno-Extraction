TI - The mitogenic effects of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  B beta chain of fibrinogen </prot>  </p1>  are mediated through cell surface <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 26602 - 6 AB - We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin ( ogen ) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen ( Gray , A.J. , Bishop , J.E. , Reeves J.T. , Mecham , R.P. , and Laurent , G.J. ( 1995 ) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12 , 684 - 690 ) .
Mitogenic sites within the fibrin ( ogen ) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein ( Gray , A.J. , Bishop , J. E. , Reeves , J.T. , and Laurent , G.J. ( 1993 ) J. Cell Sci. 104 , 409 - 413 ) .
However , receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown .
The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin ( ogen ) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  .
Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I - surface - labeled fibroblasts and purified on a <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  affinity column .
Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  bound specifically to a 60 - kDa surface protein .
Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100 % homology to human <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  .
Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti - <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  antibody provided further evidence that the 60 - kDa protein isolated in this study was <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  .
Further , polyclonal antibodies to human <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  on human fibroblasts .
The present study has shown that cell surface <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  B beta chain of fibrinogen </prot>  </p2>  mediating its mitogenic activity .
