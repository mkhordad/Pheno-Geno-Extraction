TI - Isolation of human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  delta - catenin </prot>  </p1>  and its binding specificity with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  presenilin 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 563 - 8 AB - We screened proteins for interaction with <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  presenilin ( PS ) 1 </prot>  </p1>  , and cloned the full - length cDNA of human <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  delta - catenin </prot>  </p2>  , which encoded 1225 amino acids .
Yeast two - hybrid assay , GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  delta - catenin </prot>  </p1>  interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C - terminal fragment of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p2>  , but not with that of <prot>  PS - 2 </prot>  .
These results suggest that <prot>  PS1 </prot>  and <prot>  PS2 </prot>  partly differ in function .
 <prot> PS1 </prot>  loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability .
We also found another <prot>  armadillo - protein </prot>  , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p0071 </prot>  </p1>  , interacted with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p2>  .
