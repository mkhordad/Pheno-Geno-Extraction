TI - The X - ray structure of a <prot>  growth hormone </prot>  - <prot>  prolactin </prot>  receptor complex .
PG - 478 - 81 AB - The human pituitary hormones , <prot>  growth hormone </prot>  ( <prot>  hGH </prot>  ) and <prot>  prolactin </prot>  ( <prot>  hPRL </prot>  ) , regulate a large variety of physiological processes , among which are growth and differentiation of muscle , bone and cartilage cells , and lactation .
These activities are initiated by hormone - receptor binding .
The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  hPRL </prot>  </p1>  receptors ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  , respectively ) are single - pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily .
This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains , notably a highly conserved pentapeptide , the so - called ' WSXWS box ' , the function of which is controversial .
All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms .
In the case of <prot>  hGH </prot>  , activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process : the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. <prot>  hPRL </prot>  does not bind to the <prot>  hGH </prot>  receptor , but <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to both the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor - binding sites on <prot>  hGH </prot>  overlap .
We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  bound to the extracellular domain of the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  .
Comparisons with the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  complex reveal how <prot>  hGH </prot>  can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces .
