TI - Functional significance of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes .
PG - 297 - 305 AB - <prot>  CD9 </prot>  is a member of the tetraspan ( TM4 ) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis .
As <prot>  CD9 </prot>  forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour , we investigated <prot>  CD9 </prot>  expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was present in all the living layers of the epidermis , whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer ; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes .
There was extensive co - localisation of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell - cell borders of basal keratinocytes ; however , in contrast to the integrins , <prot>  CD9 </prot>  was not found in focal adhesions .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of <prot>  CD44 </prot>  and <prot>  syndecan </prot>  , but not of cadherins .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1 ; small amounts of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  also co - immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 .
Antibodies to <prot>  CD9 </prot>  did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to <prot>  laminin 1 </prot>  , <prot>  type IV collagen </prot>  and <prot>  fibronectin </prot>  , but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic .
Like antibodies to the <prot>  beta 1 integrin </prot>  subunit , anti - <prot>  CD9 </prot>  inhibited suspension - induced terminal differentiation .
These results suggest that <prot>  CD9 </prot>  may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation .
