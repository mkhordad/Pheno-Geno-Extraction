TI - Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human <prot>  leukemia inhibitory factor </prot>  and creation of antagonists .
PG - 11971 - 8 AB - Residues in human <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  leukemia inhibitory factor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) crucial for binding to both the human <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  LIF receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( R ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of <prot>  hLIF </prot>  in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity .
The region of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  most important for binding to the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D - helix , carboxyl terminus of the B - helix , and C - D loop .
This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four - helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine <prot>  LIF </prot>  .
The two residues of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  that contribute the majority of free energy for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  binding , Phe - 156 and Lys - 159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact .
This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of <prot>  human growth hormone </prot>  for its receptor .
A second region of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D - helix and A - B loop also had a weak influence on <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  binding .
Residues in <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  from both the A - and C - helices are involved in binding the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  co - receptor .
Abolition of the <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p1>  binding site in <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p2>  created antagonists of <prot>  LIF </prot>  action .
