TI - Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells : a new oligomerization mode for serine / threonine kinase receptors .
PG - 1023 - 35 AB - The bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth .
The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine / threonine kinase receptors , whose activation has been investigated intensively for the <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta </prot>  ( <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  ) receptor subfamily .
However , the interactions between the BMP receptors , the composition of the active receptor complex , and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors .
Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand .
Using several complementary approaches , we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors ( <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  and <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  ) and the <prot>  BMP type II receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  BR - II </prot>  ) .
Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand .
These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  binding and cross - linking .
Using antibody - mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope - tagged receptors , we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p2>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  ) and homomeric ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  , and also <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  ) oligomers in the absence of ligand .
 <p1  pair=8 >  <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  </p1>  binding significantly increased hetero - and homo - oligomerization ( except for the <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  homo - oligomer , which binds ligand poorly in the absence of <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  BR - I </prot>  </p2>  ) .
In contrast to previous observations on <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors , which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand , the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern .
This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors .
