TI - Functional participation of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor gamma </prot>  chain in <prot>  <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  receptor </prot>  complexes .
PG - 1453 - 4 AB - The gamma chain of the <prot>  <prot>  interleukin - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  ) receptor </prot>  is shared with the functional <prot>  <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  receptor </prot>  and is causatively related to X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) , which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect .
Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high - affinity receptor complexes for <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells .
Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation .
