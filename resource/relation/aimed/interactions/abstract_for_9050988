TI - Identification of interaction partners for the basic - helix - loop - helix protein <prot>  E47 </prot>  .
PG - 891 - 8 AB - Helix - loop - helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo - and hetero - dimers mediated by the helix - loop - helix domain .
Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein - protein interactions in the affected cell .
In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations , the full complement of interacting proteins must be known .
To identify proteins interacting with the basic - helix - loop - helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed <prot>  E47 </prot>  protein , a ' sandwich ' - screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo - and hetero - oligomers , and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA .
Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic - helix - loop - helix domains , including a novel clone termed <prot>  eip1 </prot>  which is distantly related in the basic - helix - loop - helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer - of - split m7 protein .
Using epitope - tagging , interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p1>  basic - helix - loop - helix protein with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  eip1 </prot>  </p2>  protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells .
Interaction was also observed in the yeast two - hybrid system .
Three cDNAs encoding proteins without basic - helix - loop - helix domains were also found to interact in the sandwich - expression screen .
Interactions with human <prot>  PARP </prot>  and mouse <prot>  replication factor 1a </prot>  were confirmed using glutathione transferase - tagged cDNAs .
A cDNA encoding part of the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  nucleolin </prot>  </p1>  protein sequence interacted with the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p2>  basic - helix - loop - helix only when fused to a beta - galactosidase tag .
