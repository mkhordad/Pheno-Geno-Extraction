TI - Characterization of a novel high affinity human <prot>  <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Expression on T cells and association with <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation .
PG - 4753 - 63 AB - Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , only activated T cells can proliferate to IL - 7 .
This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  during T - cell activation .
We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross - linking studies , and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  of 90 kDa , whereas activated T cells express an additional 76 - kDa <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  binding protein .
In this study the origin and function of the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  molecules have been investigated .
To determine the role of each of these receptors in <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation , <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation .
These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  correlated with expression of the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and not with expression of the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
 <prot> IL - 7 </prot>  - driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and accordingly , Scatchard analysis revealed that , like the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  bound <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  with dual ( high ; Kd 38 pM and low ; Kd 360 pM ) affinity .
Deglycosylation studies showed that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor .
In agreement , mAb to the previously cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  but not T - cell clones that express predominantly the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  as a 90 - kDa species from both 125 - I - surface - labeled resting and activated T cells , but were unable to precipitate the 76 - kDa <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
In addition , PCR analysis of <prot>  p76 </prot>  - expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , thereby excluding the possibility that the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
These data demonstrate that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  is the T - cell homologue of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and imply that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  have different extracellular domains .
Taken together these data suggest that the 76 - kDa receptor is a novel high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  that may be necessary for <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation in human T cells .
