TI - Soluble <prot>  <prot>  interleukin 2 </prot>  receptor </prot>  and <prot>  interleukin 1alpha </prot>  in toxic epidermal necrolysis : a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples .
AB - BACKGROUND : Toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease , characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways , in particular with early participation of activated <prot>  CD8 </prot>  + T lymphocytes .
OBJECTIVE : To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis .
DESIGN : Prospective study .
SETTING : University hospitals .
PATIENTS : Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second - degree burns .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Measurement of soluble <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 2 receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  ) and <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters .
RESULTS : In the blister fluid of patients with TEN , we found significantly higher levels of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  than in patients with burns , whereas <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients .
No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns , in either <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  .
In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  in the blister fluid compared with serum samples , pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  in the blister fluid of burned patients .
CONCLUSIONS : Our findings of elevated <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down - regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN .
