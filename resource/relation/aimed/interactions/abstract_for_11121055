TI - Loss of <prot>  fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 </prot>  ligand - binding specificity in Apert syndrome .
PG - 14536 - 41 AB - Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes ( Fgfrs ) .
Apert syndrome ( AS ) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations .
AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues ( S252W or P253R ) in the highly conserved region linking Ig - like domains II and III of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .
Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .
We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGFR2c </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGF7 </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGF10 </prot>  </p2>  and the epithelial splice form of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGFR2b </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to be activated by <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  FGF2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FGF6 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGF9 </prot>  </p2>  .
These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation .
These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand - dependent activation of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .
