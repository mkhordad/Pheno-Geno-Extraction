TI - Elimination of false negative results in the two - hybrid system in the phagocyte <prot>  NADPH oxidase </prot>  .
PG - 301 - 5 AB - The yeast two - hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins .
In this method , two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA - binding domain ( bd ) and activating domain ( ad ) , respectively .
Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters .
The phagocyte <prot>  NADPH oxidase </prot>  is a complex of membrane <prot>  cytochrome b558 </prot>  ( comprised of subunits <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  p22 - phox </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  gp91 - phox </prot>  </p2>  ) and three cytosol proteins ( <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  p47 - phox </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p67 - phox </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p21rac </prot>  </p2>  ) that translocate to membrane and bind to <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  cytochrome b558 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  .
This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of <prot>  cytochrome b558 </prot>  , <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  p47 - phox </prot>  </p1>  binding to <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p67 - phox </prot>  </p2>  each other .
We encountered several methodological problems in the two - hybrid system which are the focus of this report .
