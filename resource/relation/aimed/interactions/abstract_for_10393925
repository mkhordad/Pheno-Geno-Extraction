TI - Endogenous <prot>  presenilin 1 </prot>  redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix .
PG - 7932 - 7 AB - Most familial early - onset Alzheimer 's disease cases are caused by mutations in the <prot>  presenilin 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PS1 </prot>  ) gene .
Subcellular localization of the endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is essential for understanding its function , interactions with proteins , and role in Alzheimer 's disease .
Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi , there are conflicting reports on the localization of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  to the cell surface .
We found that endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is highly expressed in T lymphocytes ( Jurkat cells ) .
Using a variety of methods , we present evidence that endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments .
Moreover , <prot>  PS1 </prot>  appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix .
The redistribution of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44 .
Cell surface <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  formed complexes in vivo with actin - binding protein <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  filamin </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ABP - 280 </prot>  </p2>  ) , which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility .
Taken together , our results suggest a role of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  in cell adhesion and / or cell - matrix interaction .
