TI - Adeno - associated virus vector - mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) vectors .
METHODS : The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes , <prot>  tyrosine hydroxylase </prot>  ( <prot>  TH </prot>  ) , <prot>  aromatic L - amino acid decarboxylase </prot>  ( <prot>  AADC </prot>  ) , and <prot>  GTP cyclohydrolase I </prot>  ( <prot>  GCH </prot>  , an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis ) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors .
Expressions of <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  were detected by Western blot analysis .
Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high - performance liquid chromatography .
RESULTS : <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors , AAV - <prot>  TH </prot>  , AAV - <prot>  AADC </prot>  and AAV - <prot>  GCH </prot>  .
Furthermore , the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells .
CONCLUSION : The triple transduction of <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  genes with separate AAV vectors is effective , which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson 's disease .
