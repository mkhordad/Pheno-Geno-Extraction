TI - Formation of <prot>  p27 </prot>  - CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle .
PG - 135 - 46 AB - In eukaryotic cells , the coordinated activation of different cyclin - dependent kinases regulates entry into S - phase .
In vitro and in nonproliferating cells , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with and inhibits cyclin / cycin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) holoenzymes containing either <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p2>  , or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  .
Although many different types of proliferating cells contain <prot>  p27 </prot>  protein , neither the interactions of <prot>  p27 </prot>  with cyclin / CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored .
We report that , in MANCA cells , the amount of <prot>  p27 </prot>  is constant during the cell cycle .
In addition , <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with three different CDKs : <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , the amount of <prot>  p27 </prot>  is significantly lower than the amount of <prot>  cyclin D3 </prot>  in these cells .
The amount of <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p1>  associated with <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  does not change in a cell cycle - dependent fashion ; in contrast , the amount of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p1>  associated with <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p2>  is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid - G1 phase , reaching a steady - state level in late G1 - phase cells .
After mid - G1 phase , the amount of each <prot>  p27 </prot>  / CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle .
 <prot> p27 </prot>  - immunoprecipitates contain an Rb - kinase activity .
The substrate specificity , the expression pattern of this kinase , and the ability to deplete 50 % of this kinase activity with a <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  - specific antibody suggest that the <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  protein mediates , in part , the <prot>  p27 </prot>  - associated <prot>  Rb </prot>  - kinase activity .
In contrast , <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  complexes containing <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  are incapable of phosphorylating <prot>  histone H1 </prot>  .
These data are consistent with a model wherein <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  / CDK complexes sequester the <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  - dependent kinase inhibitory activity of <prot>  p27 </prot>  .
