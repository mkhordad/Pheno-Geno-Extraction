TI - Two distinct and independent sites on <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  trigger <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  gp 130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer formation and signalling .
PG - 1942 - 51 AB - The helical cytokine <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 6 </prot>  </p1>  and its specific binding subunit <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  form a 1:1 complex which , by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  on the surface of target cells , triggers intracellular responses .
We expressed differently tagged forms of <prot>  gp130 </prot>  and used them in solution - phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes .
In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface ( site 2 , comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices , and site 3 , in the terminal part of the CD loop ) .
The binding affinity to <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent .
We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  variants complexed with <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  bind a single <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  molecule but are unable to dimerize it , whereas the combined site 2 / 3 variants lose the ability to interact with <prot>  gp130 </prot>  .
The binding properties of these variants in vitro , and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3 , lead to the conclusion that <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , two <p1  pair=12 >  <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and two <p2  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  molecules .
We propose here a model representing the <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  receptor complex as hexameric , which might be common to other helical cytokines .
