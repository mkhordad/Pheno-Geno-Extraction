TI - Identification of an 11 - kDa <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  - rapamycin - binding domain within the 289 - kDa <prot>  FKBP12 - rapamycin - associated protein </prot>  and characterization of a critical serine residue .
PG - 4947 - 51 AB - Complexed with its intracellular receptor , <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  , the natural product rapamycin inhibits G1 progression of the cell cycle in a variety of mammalian cell lines and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae .
Previously , a mammalian protein that directly associates with <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  </p1>  - rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human ( designated <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  FRAP </prot>  </p2>  ) [ Brown , E.J. , Albers , M.W. , Shin , T.B. , Ichikawa , K. , Keith , C.T. , Lane , W.S. AMPPPP Schreiber , S.L. ( 1994 ) Nature ( London ) 369 , 756 - 758 ] and rat ( designated <prot>  RAFT </prot>  ) [ Sabatini , D.M. , Erdjument - Bromage , H. , Lui , M. , Tempst , P. AMPPPP Snyder , S.H. ( 1994 ) Cell 78 , 35 - 43 ] .
The full - length <prot>  FRAP </prot>  is a 289 - kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain .
Using an in vitro transcription / translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies , we have identified an 11 - kDa <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  </p1>  - rapamycin - binding domain within <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FRAP </prot>  </p2>  .
This minimal binding domain lies N - terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025 - 2114 .
In addition , we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035 , a potential phosphorylation site for <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  within this domain .
We now show that the <prot>  FRAP </prot>  Ser2035 -- GTTTTT Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild - type protein , whereas all other mutations at this site , including mimics of phosphoserine , abolish binding , presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes .
