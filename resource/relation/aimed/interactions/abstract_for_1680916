TI - Coassociation of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  </p1>  ) with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD45 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  on the surface of human T lymphocytes .
PG - 2514 - 7 AB - In the present report , we demonstrated that modulation of <prot>  CD26 </prot>  from T cell surface induced by anti <prot>  CD26 </prot>  ( 1F7 ) led to enhanced phosphorylation of <prot>  CD3 </prot>  zeta tyrosine residues and increased <prot>  CD4 </prot>  associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity .
We further showed that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  was comodulated on the T cell surface with <prot>  CD45 </prot>  , a known membrane - linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti - <prot>  CD26 </prot>  was capable of precipitating <prot>  CD45 </prot>  from T cell lysates .
These findings strongly suggest that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  may be closely associated with the <prot>  CD45 </prot>  protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD45 </prot>  </p2>  results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity , zeta chain phosphorylation , and T cell activation .
