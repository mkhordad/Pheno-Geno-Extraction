TI - The T - cell antigen <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p1>  acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein - tyrosine kinase <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 2862 - 70 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p1>  is a T - cell - specific antigen which binds to the B - cell antigen <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD72 </prot>  </p2>  and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T - cell growth .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> CD5 </prot>  </p1>  associates with the <p2  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  T - cell receptor zeta chain </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  TcR zeta </prot>  </p1>  ) / <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CD3 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of <prot>  TcR zeta </prot>  / <prot>  CD3 </prot>  ligation .
However , despite this , the mechanism by which <prot>  CD5 </prot>  generates intracellular signals is unclear .
In this study , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is coupled to the protein - tyrosine kinase <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p2>  and can act as a substrate for <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p2>  .
Coexpression of <prot>  CD5 </prot>  with <prot>  p56lck </prot>  in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of <prot>  CD5 </prot>  on tyrosine residues .
Further , anti - <prot>  CD5 </prot>  and anti - <prot>  p56lck </prot>  coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents , including Nonidet P - 40 and Triton X - 100 .
Anti - <prot>  CD5 </prot>  also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of <prot>  TcR zeta </prot>  / <prot>  CD3 </prot>  or <prot>  CD4 </prot>  .
No binding between <prot>  p59fyn </prot>  ( T ) and <prot>  CD5 </prot>  was detected in T cells .
The binding of <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  induced a 10 - to 15 - fold increase in <prot>  p56lck </prot>  catalytic activity , as measured by in vitro kinase analysis .
In vivo labelling with 32P ( i ) also showed a four - to fivefold increase in Y - 394 occupancy in <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  when associated with <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  .
The use of glutathione S - transferase - Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  could recognize <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  as expressed in the baculovirus expression system .
 <p1  pair=11 > CD5 </p1>  interaction w <prot>  ith </prot>  <p2  pair=11 >  p56lck </p2>  represents a novel variant of a receptor - kinas <prot>  e compl </prot>  ex in which receptor can also serve as substrate.
