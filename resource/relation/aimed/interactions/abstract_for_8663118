TI - Cloning and characterization of a specific <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) - 13 </prot>  binding protein structurally related to the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 5 </prot>  receptor </prot>  alpha chain .
PG - 16921 - 6 AB - <prot>  Interleukin - 13 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  ) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many , but not all , biological activities with <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  .
These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components .
Two proteins have been described as constituents of the <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  receptor , a approximately 140 - kDa glycoprotein ( <prot>  IL - 4R </prot>  ) and the gamma chain ( gammac ) of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor </prot>  , but neither of these proteins binds <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  .
We have cloned a cDNA encoding an <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  </p1>  binding protein ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13R </prot>  </p2>  ) from the Caki - 1 human renal carcinoma cell line .
The cloned cDNA encodes a 380 - amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail .
The <prot>  IL - 13R </prot>  shows homology with the <prot>  IL - 5 </prot>  receptor , and to a lesser extent , with the prolactin receptor .
COS - 7 cells transfected with the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 13R </prot>  </p1>  cDNA bind <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  </p2>  with high affinity but do not bind <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  .
COS - 7 cells co - transfected with the cloned <prot>  IL - 13R </prot>  cDNA and <prot>  IL - 4R </prot>  cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  .
Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  .
