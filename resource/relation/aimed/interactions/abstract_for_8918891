TI - SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the <prot>  <prot>  CREB </prot>  - binding protein </prot>  .
PG - 2903 - 11 AB - The sterol regulatory element binding proteins ( <prot>  SREBP - 1 </prot>  and - 2 ) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol .
Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP , little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function .
In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP , we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound <prot>  SREBP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  SREBP - 2 </prot>  .
Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265 - kD protein was <prot>  CBP </prot>  ( <prot>  CREB - binding protein </prot>  ) a recently identified transcriptional coactivator .
The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino - terminal domains of recombinant <prot>  CBP </prot>  and <prot>  p300 </prot>  ( a <prot>  CBP </prot>  - related protein ) .
Moreover , transfection studies demonstrated that <prot>  CBP </prot>  enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells .
Together , these data suggest that <prot>  CBP </prot>  mediates SREBP transcriptional activity , thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism .
