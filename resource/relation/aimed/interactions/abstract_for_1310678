TI - Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  , and <prot>  p50 </prot>  in a cell - free system .
PG - 2902 - 8 AB - A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90 - kDa heat shock protein ( <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  ) has been used here to form complexes between the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  tyrosine kinase and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  .
Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p1>  and a temperature - sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  pp60v - src </prot>  </p2>  , which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form .
In addition , <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  in the lysate complexes with wild - type <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  pp60v - src </prot>  </p2>  , of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex , and with the cellular homolog , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  pp60c - src </prot>  </p2>  , which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  .
Moreover , the reticulocyte lysate - reconstituted complex also contains the 50 - kDa phosphoprotein component of the native <prot>  pp60v - src </prot>  multiprotein complex .
The native and reconstituted <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  complexes have similar thermal stability and , like steroid receptor heterocomplexes , they are stabilized by molybdate .
As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate - reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes , the reconstituted <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  multiprotein complex contains <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  , which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  association .
