TI - Two - hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta - amyloid peptide monomers .
PG - 2065 - 70 AB - The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  ( <prot>  Abeta </prot>  ) are typical of a nucleation - dependent polymerization mechanism .
This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis .
Interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  with itself was explored with the yeast two - hybrid system .
Fusion proteins were created by linking the <prot>  Abeta </prot>  fragment to a <prot>  LexA </prot>  DNA - binding domain ( bait ) and also to a <prot>  B42 </prot>  transactivation domain ( prey ) .
Protein - protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring <prot>  lacZ </prot>  ( <prot>  beta - galactosidase </prot>  ) and <prot>  LEU2 </prot>  ( <prot>  leucine utilization </prot>  ) genes under the control of LexA - dependent operators .
This approach suggests that the <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus .
 <prot> LexA </prot>  protein fused to the Drosophila protein <prot>  bicoid </prot>  ( <prot>  LexA </prot>  - <prot>  bicoid </prot>  ) failed to interact with the <prot>  B42 </prot>  fragment fused to <prot>  Abeta </prot>  , indicating that the observed <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  interaction was specific .
Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing <prot>  LexA </prot>  - <prot>  Abeta </prot>  bait when the <prot>  B42 </prot>  transactivation domain was fused to an <prot>  Abeta </prot>  fragment with Phe - Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr - Thr ( AbetaTT ) , a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others .
Moreover , when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native <prot>  Abeta </prot>  - ( 1 - 40 ) , it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy .
The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two - hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation - dependent aggregation .
