TI - Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor .
PG - 361 - 70 AB - A human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced .
Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF .
The TNF receptor ( TNF - R ) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane - spanning region .
The extracellular cysteine - rich domain of the TNF - R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the <prot>  B cell activation protein </prot>  <prot>  Bp50 </prot>  .
Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF - R expression vector specifically bind both 125I - labeled and biotinylated <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  .
Unlabeled <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  to TNF - R expressing cells .
Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF - R in a variety of cell types .
Therefore , the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF - R .
