TI - Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit ( <prot>  RII beta </prot>  ) of <prot>  cAMP - dependent protein kinase II beta </prot>  reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimerization and / or anchoring <prot>  RII beta </prot>  to the cytoskeleton .
PG - 1935 - 44 AB - In neurons <prot>  cAMP - dependent protein kinase II beta </prot>  ( <prot>  PKAII beta </prot>  ) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit ( <prot>  RII beta </prot>  ) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins ( AKAPs ) .
The prototypic neuronal anchor protein <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p1>  has a COOH - terminal 22 - residue <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  binding ( tethering ) site .
A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high - affinity binding of <prot>  RII beta </prot>  .
Mutagenesis , recombinant protein expression , and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p1>  binding activities of <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  .
Several crucial residues are located in an NH2 - terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13 - 36 .
Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric <prot>  RII beta </prot>  subunits that cannot bind <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  .
The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant <prot>  RII beta </prot>  monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of <prot>  PKAII beta </prot>  with the same affinity and efficacy as wild - type <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimers .
Moreover , substitution of Ala for Leu12 , Val20 , Leu21 , Phe31 , Leu33 , or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction .
Evidently , large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  interactions .
A secondary consequence of destabilizing <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting / anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  .
Other NH2 - terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  dimers for the <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p2>  tethering site .
Replacement of Val20 - Leu21 with Ala - Ala produced a dimeric <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p1>  protein that binds <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p2>  approximately 4 % as avidly as wild - type <prot>  RII beta </prot>  .
It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  tethering region .
