TI - Cloning and expression of human <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  : a TBP - associated factor implicated in cell - cycle regulation .
PG - 175 - 9 AB - Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors ( <prot>  TFIIA - J </prot>  ) and can be regulated by various promoter - specific DNA binding proteins .
An additional class of factors , called coactivators , are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators .
Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) to form the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex .
We therefore set out to define the relationship between <prot>  TBP </prot>  and these TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) .
Here we describe the cloning , expression and properties of the first human TAF , <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  .
The <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  gene is identical to a gene , <prot>  CCG1 </prot>  , ( ref 7 , 8 ) , implicated in cell - cycle progression .
Recombinant <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  both in vitro and in yeast , and participates in the formation of the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex .
This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in <prot>  TFIID </prot>  assembly by interacting with both <prot>  TBP </prot>  and other TAFs , as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle .
