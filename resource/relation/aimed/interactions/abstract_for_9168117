TI - Interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  protein and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  in response to DNA damage .
PG - 520 - 3 AB - The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , designated <prot>  ATM </prot>  ( for ' <prot>  AT mutated </prot>  ' ) , is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase - like enzymes that are involved in cell - cycle control , meiotic recombination , telomere length monitoring and DNA - damage response .
Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1 / S checkpoint after radiation damage .
Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  are also defective in radiation - induced G1 arrest , we investigated the possibility that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  might interact with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  in response to radiation damage .
Here we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  binds <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells .
Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p1>  interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif ( residues 1 , 373 - 1 , 382 ) of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p2>  .
The results also reveal that radiation - induction of <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells .
These findings indicate that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  is involved in the activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation - induced G1 arrest .
