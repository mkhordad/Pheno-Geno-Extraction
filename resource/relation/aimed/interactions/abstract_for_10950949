TI - Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in <prot>  fibroblast growth factor - 7 </prot>  .
PG - 34881 - 6 AB - Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors ( FGFRs ) .
Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGFR2 IIIb </prot>  </p2>  isoform or <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  keratinocyte growth factor </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  ) , whereas <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  binds well to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  FGFR4 </prot>  </p2>  but interacts poorly with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  .
Previously , mutations in <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding , known as the primary receptor - binding site .
 <p1  pair=8 >  <prot> FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  .
The sequences that confer on <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  its specific binding to <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  have not been identified .
By utilizing domain swapping and site - directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4 - beta5 strands of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  recognition .
Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  dramatically reduced both the affinity of <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  FGF7 </prot>  </p1>  for <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  .
Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  reduced both binding affinity and biological potency .
The reciprocal loop replacement mutant ( <prot>  FGF2 </prot>  - L4 / 7 ) retained <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  like affinity for <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  and for <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  .
Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF .
