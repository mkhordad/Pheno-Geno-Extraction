TI - Correlation of two - hybrid affinity data with in vitro measurements .
PG - 5820 - 9 AB - Since their introduction , the interaction trap and other two - hybrid systems have been used to study protein - protein interactions .
Despite their general use , little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two - hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques .
In this study , we used a set of lexAop - LEU2 and lexAop - lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap .
For the calibration , we used two sets of proteins , the <prot>  Myc </prot>  - <prot>  Max </prot>  - <prot>  Mxi1 </prot>  helix - loop - helix proteins , and wild - type and dimerization - defective versions of the lambda cI repressor .
Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two - hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro , permitting discrimination of high - , intermediate - , and low - affinity interactions , but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro .
However , some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions .
Finally , some interactions were subject to directionality , and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used .
Taken together , our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two - hybrid experiments .
