TI - Multiple proteins physically interact with <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  .
Transcriptional synergy with <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  ( C / <prot>  EBP delta </prot>  , <prot>  CRP3 </prot>  ) .
PG - 4330 - 8 AB - <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins .
In this study , we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  .
Using radiolabeled <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  protein as a probe , we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  interacting proteins .
Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins ( <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  , <prot>  HMG I / Y </prot>  , and <prot>  SSRP </prot>  ) , one clone encodes a chaperone protein , and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase .
We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  </p2>  , a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses .
We found that deletion of the carboxyl - terminal 28 amino acids of <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  disrupted <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  </p2>  physical interaction .
This deletion disrupts the <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  Ets domain .
Deletion of the <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins .
In transient expression assays , we found that <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  and <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  and <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites , but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other 's DNA binding .
These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex .
