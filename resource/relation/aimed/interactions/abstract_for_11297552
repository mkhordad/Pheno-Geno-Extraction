TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Platelet - derived growth factor C </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PDGF - C </prot>  </p1>  ) , a novel growth factor that binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  PDGF alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and beta receptor .
PG - 27406 - 14 AB - We have characterized <prot>  platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) C </prot>  , a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family .
 <prot> PDGF - C </prot>  is a multidomain protein with the N - terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of <prot>  neuropilin - 1 </prot>  , and the C - terminal region consists of a growth factor domain ( GFD ) with homology to vascular <prot>  endothelial growth factor </prot>  ( 25 % ) and <prot>  PDGF A </prot>  - chain ( 23 % ) .
A serum - sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain .
Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both <prot>  PDGF alpha </prot>  and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD ( <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  PDGF - CC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  PDGF receptor - alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimers and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  PDGF receptor - alpha </prot>  </p2>  / beta heterodimers .
 <prot> PDGF - CC </prot>  exhibits greater mitogenic potency than <prot>  PDGF - AA </prot>  and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than <prot>  PDGF - AB </prot>  and <prot>  PDGF - BB </prot>  on several mesenchymal cell types .
Analysis of <prot>  PDGF - CC </prot>  in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that <prot>  PDGF - CC </prot>  significantly enhanced repair of a full - thickness skin excision .
Together , these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family ( <prot>  PDGF - C </prot>  ) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to <prot>  PDGF - AB </prot>  .
