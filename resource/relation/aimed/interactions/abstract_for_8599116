TI - Coordination of three signaling enzymes by <prot>  AKAP79 </prot>  , a mammalian scaffold protein .
PG - 1589 - 92 AB - Multivalent binding proteins , such as the yeast scaffold protein <prot>  Sterile - 5 </prot>  , coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units .
Similarly , in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate - dependent protein kinase ( <prot>  PKA </prot>  ) and <prot>  phosphatase 2B </prot>  [ <prot>  calcineurin </prot>  ( <prot>  CaN </prot>  ) ] are complexed by an <prot>  A kinase anchoring protein </prot>  , <prot>  AKAP79 </prot>  .
Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme , <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  ( <prot>  PKC </prot>  ) , binds <prot>  AKAP79 </prot>  at a site distinct from those bound by <prot>  PKA </prot>  or <prot>  CaN </prot>  .
The subcellular distributions of <prot>  PKC </prot>  and <prot>  AKAP79 </prot>  were similar in neurons .
Thus , <prot>  AKAP79 </prot>  appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes .
