TI - Cross - family dimerization of transcription factors <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Fos </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Jun </prot>  </p2>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  ATF </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CREB </prot>  </p2>  alters DNA binding specificity .
PG - 3720 - 4 AB - The <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes .
Like many eukaryotic transcription factors , these proteins bind to DNA as dimers .
Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the AMPPPP quot ; leucine - zipper AMPPPP quot ; motif .
Although <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements ( the AP - 1 / TRE and ATF / CRE sites , respectively ) , we find that members of these two families form selective cross - family heterodimers .
The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers .
These findings indicate that the <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought .
We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors .
