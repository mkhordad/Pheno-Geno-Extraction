TI - Activation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  by 14 - 3 - 3 proteins .
PG - 612 - 4 AB - The protein <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation , associates with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  p21ras </prot>  </p2>  ( refs 1 - 3 ) .
However , the regulation of the serine / threonine kinase activity of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is still not understood .
Using the yeast two - hybrid system , we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .
These proteins , <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  ( <prot>  PLA2 </prot>  ) and <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 beta </prot>  ( <prot>  HS1 </prot>  ) , are members of the 14 - 3 - 3 family of proteins .
Expression of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activity and promoted <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  - dependent oocyte maturation .
A dominant negative mutant of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  blocked the effects of 14 - 3 - 3 protein .
