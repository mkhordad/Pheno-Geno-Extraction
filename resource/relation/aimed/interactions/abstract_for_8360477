TI - Involvement of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  signal transducer <prot>  gp130 </prot>  in <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  - mediated signal transduction .
PG - 2555 - 61 AB - <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
We have previously identified <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  specific binding protein which is distinct from that of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in a number of cell lines .
The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  prompted us to investigate whether <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  shares common signal transduction mechanisms with <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
We have examined early signals triggered by <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in a multifactor - dependent human erythroleukemic cell line , TF - 1 .
The results showed that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  can both stimulate cell proliferation , induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and activate the same proto - oncogene ( <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  junB </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) expression in TF - 1 cells .
These findings imply that <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  .
We next tested whether <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  induced signaling can be inhibited by anti - <prot>  gp130 </prot>  antibodies which blocked <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  - mediated functions .
It was observed that anti - <prot>  gp130 </prot>  antibodies abolished cell proliferation , protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and <prot>  junB </prot>  gene expression elicited by <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in TF - 1 cells .
The same antibodies , however , had no effect on granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin - induced TF - 1 cell proliferation .
Finally , anti - <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  antibody inhibited the ability of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , but not <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  , to transduce early signals in TF - 1 cells .
These results demonstrate that <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  utilize different ligand binding proteins , but share common signal transducer , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  , in TF - 1 cells .
