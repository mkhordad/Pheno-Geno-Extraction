TI - Regulation of cell proliferation , apoptosis , and carcinogenesis by activin AB - The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which <prot>  activin A </prot>  modulates cell proliferation , apoptosis , and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo .
 <prot> Activin A </prot>  , a member of the <prot>  TGFbeta </prot>  superfamily , has various effects on diverse biological systems , including cell growth inhibition in many cell types .
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood .
This review highlights activin 's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway , modulation of activin signaling , and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin .
Based on the experiences of all the authors , we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  p21 </prot>  and regulators of apoptosis such as <prot>  p53 </prot>  and members of the <prot>  bcl - 2 </prot>  family .
Aside from activin 's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis , other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression .
These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding , a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA - PCR approach , and a messenger RNA - antisense DNA interference phenomenon ( D - RNAi ) , resulting in a long - term gene knockout effects .
