TI - Structure of an extracellular <prot>  gp130 </prot>  cytokine receptor signaling complex .
PG - 2150 - 5 AB - The activation of <prot>  gp130 </prot>  , a shared signal - transducing receptor for a family of cytokines , is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex .
Kaposi 's sarcoma - associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ) that activates human <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  and human <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  , two complexes are cross - linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p1>  and site III of viral <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  , which is necessary for receptor activation .
Unlike human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( which uses many hydrophilic residues ) , the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  , which enhances the complementarity of the viral <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  binding interfaces .
The cross - reactivity of <prot>  gp130 </prot>  is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic <prot>  gp130 </prot>  cytokine - binding sites .
