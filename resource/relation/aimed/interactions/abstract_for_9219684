TI - The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RasGAP </prot>  </p2>  complex : structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic <prot>  Ras </prot>  mutants .
PG - 333 - 8 AB - The three - dimensional structure of the complex between human <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  H - Ras </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) - activating domain of the human <prot>  GTPase - activating protein </prot>  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p120GAP </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  </p2>  ) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms .
The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules , which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids .
An arginine side chain ( arginine - 789 ) of <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  is supplied into the active site of <prot>  Ras </prot>  to neutralize developing charges in the transition state .
The switch II region of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  is stabilized by <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  </p2>  , thus allowing glutamine - 61 of <prot>  Ras </prot>  , mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential , to participate in catalysis .
The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of <prot>  Ras </prot>  by glycine - 12 and glutamine - 61 mutations .
Glycine - 12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine - 789 of <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  and glutamine - 61 of <prot>  Ras </prot>  , and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state .
