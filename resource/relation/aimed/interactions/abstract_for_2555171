TI - Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor .
PG - 3667 - 76 AB - Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor </prot>  </p1>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGM - CSF - R </prot>  </p2>  ) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA .
Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM - CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach .
The cloned <prot>  GM - CSF - R </prot>  precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide ( Mr 45 , 000 ) with a single transmembrane domain , a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short ( 54 amino acids ) intracytoplasmic tail .
It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family , but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors , including those for <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  , <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  and <prot>  interleukin - 2 </prot>  ( beta - chain ) and also to the prolactin receptor .
When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  GM - CSF - R </prot>  </p1>  showing a single class of affinity ( KD = 2 ( - 8 ) nM ) and specificity for human <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  GM - CSF </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  interleukin - 3 </prot>  .
Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display <prot>  hGM - CSF </prot>  binding , and cross - linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells .
