TI - A new cytokine - receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  receptor </prot>  with an antagonist .
PG - 194 - 200 AB - Inflammation , regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage , starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines <prot>  interleukin - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  tumour necrosis factor - alpha </prot>  ( ref. 1 ) .
Three naturally occurring ligands for the <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  IL1R </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) exist : the agonists <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and the <prot>  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  - receptor </prot>  </p1>  antagonist </prot>  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL1RA </prot>  </p2>  ( ref. 2 ) .
 <prot> IL - 1 </prot>  is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known .
Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  type - I <prot>  IL1R </prot>  </prot>  </p1>  complexed with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL1RA </prot>  </p2>  .
The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin - like domains .
Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked , but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker .
Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical <prot>  IL1RA </prot>  residues which were identified by site - directed mutagenesis .
A region that is important for biological function in <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , the ' receptor trigger site ' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the <prot>  IL1RA </prot>  complex .
Modelling studies suggest that this <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3 .
