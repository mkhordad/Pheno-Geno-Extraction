TI - Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C - terminal domain of Alzheimer 's <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  apolipoprotein E </prot>  </p2>  alpha - helices .
PG - 758 - 69 AB - In a previous work , we predicted and demonstrated that the 29 - 42 - residue fragment of <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  ( <prot>  Abeta peptide </prot>  ) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins .
We further demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  apolipoprotein E2 </prot>  </p1>  and E3 but not <prot>  apolipoprotein E4 </prot>  can decrease the fusogenic activity of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  ( 29 - 42 ) via a direct interaction .
Therefore , we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  and in the protective effects of <prot>  apolipoprotein E </prot>  in Alzheimer 's disease .
Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the <prot>  Abeta </prot>  C - terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion , we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion .
In this study , we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of <prot>  apolipoproteins E </prot>  and A - I with <prot>  Abeta </prot>  and simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling .
We further calculated cross - interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro .
The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  ( 29 - 42 ) and SIV peptides .
Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C - terminal amphipathic helices .
