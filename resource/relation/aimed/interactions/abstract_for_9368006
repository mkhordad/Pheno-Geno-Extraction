TI - Interaction between cell cycle regulator , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p2>  mediates repression of HIV - 1 gene transcription .
PG - 29468 - 74 AB - The <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  / <prot>  Rel </prot>  family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV - 1 gene expression .
Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p1>  and its partner <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
Earlier studies indicated that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  , a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S - phase - specific genes , is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) type - 1 promoter in a variety of cells , including those of glial and lymphocytic origin .
Here , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  may regulate the activity of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  enhancer region and to interact with the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p2>  subunit , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  .
Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  elements .
Gel retardation / immunoblot analysis using purified <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins .
Affinity chromatography and co - immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  in the absence of their DNA target sequences .
In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  represses <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  mediated transcription in a cell - free system .
Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the <prot>  E2F </prot>  and <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  binding sites in <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  mediated repression of HIV - 1 promoter , in vivo .
The results of this study suggest that <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p1>  activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein , <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
