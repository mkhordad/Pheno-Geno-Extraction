TI - Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal AB - Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar .
There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology , and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank .
Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages , documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations , for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro .
Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins ( <prot>  procollagen I </prot>  , <prot>  collagenase </prot>  , <prot>  elastin </prot>  , <prot>  hyaluronic acid synthase 2 </prot>  , <prot>  hyaluronidase </prot>  , <prot>  fibronectin </prot>  , <prot>  cd44 </prot>  , <prot>  fibromodulin </prot>  , and <prot>  decorin </prot>  ) across cell passages ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 10 for tracheal scar ) revealed varied growth patterns .
Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures , whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures .
Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made .
