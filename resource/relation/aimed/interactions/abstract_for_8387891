TI - Crystal structure of the soluble human 55 kd TNF receptor - human <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  complex : implications for TNF receptor activation .
PG - 431 - 45 AB - The X - ray crystal structure of the complex of the extracellular domain of the human 55 kd tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor with human <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  has been determined at 2.85 A resolution .
The complex has three receptor molecules bound symmetrically to one <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  trimer .
The receptor fragment , a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar folding domains , binds in the groove between two adjacent <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  subunits .
The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the ligand with respect to the cell membrane and provides a model for TNF receptor activation .
The novel fold of the TNF receptor structure is likely to be representative of the <prot>  nerve growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  NGF </prot>  ) / TNF receptor family as a whole .
