TI - Human gastrinoma cells express <prot>  calcium - sensing receptor </prot>  .
AB - The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma .
However , the mechanism underlying calcium - evoked <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release is not fully understood .
We investigated the mechanism of calcium - stimulated <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the <prot>  calcium - sensing receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  CaR </prot>  ) .
Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery .
In the perifusion system , high [ Ca2+ ] o induced <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release from gastrinoma cells .
As [ Ca2+ ] o increased , [ Ca2+ ] i rapidly increased , as monitored by fluorometry .
The response was not inhibited by nifedipine , a blocker of the voltage - dependent calcium channel .
Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the <prot>  CaR </prot>  gene in human gastrinoma tissues .
Moreover , the expression of <prot>  CaR </prot>  in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry .
Our results demonstrated that <prot>  CaR </prot>  was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium - evoked <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release .
