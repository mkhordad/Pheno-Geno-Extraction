TI - Characterization of the <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binding proteins <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RBP2 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 3149 - 56 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product , <prot>  pRB </prot>  , regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins .
Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to <prot>  pRB </prot>  and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated .
The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor <prot>  E2F </prot>  .
We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full - length coding sequence of two other proteins , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RBP2 </prot>  </p1>  , cloned originally by their interaction with <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  pRB </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
The products of the <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  and <prot>  RBP2 </prot>  genes are ubiquitously expressed , large ( 200 kDa for <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  and 195 kDa for <prot>  RBP2 </prot>  ) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation .
In addition we have been able to identify complexes of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  pRB </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  </p2>  in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus <prot>  E7 </prot>  protein .
