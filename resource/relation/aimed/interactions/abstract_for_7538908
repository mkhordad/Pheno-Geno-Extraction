TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RIP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  : a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  APO - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD95 </prot>  </p2>  ) in yeast and causes cell death .
PG - 513 - 23 AB - Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor <prot>  Fas </prot>  / <prot>  APO - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  CD95 </prot>  ) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells .
Using a genetic selection based on protein - protein interaction in yeast , we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  : <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  itself , and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RIP </prot>  </p2>  , for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  receptor interacting protein </prot>  </p2>  .
 <p1  pair=7 >  <prot> RIP </prot>  </p1>  also interacts weakly with the <prot>  p55 </prot>  tumor necrosis factor receptor ( <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  </p2>  ) intracellular domain , but not with a mutant version of <prot>  Fas </prot>  corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation .
 <prot> RIP </prot>  contains an N - terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C - terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif ( death domain ) present in the <prot>  Fas </prot>  and <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  intracellular domains .
Transient overexpression of <prot>  RIP </prot>  causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis .
Taken together , these properties indicate that <prot>  RIP </prot>  is a novel form of apoptosis - inducing protein .
