TI - Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo .
PG - 977 - 86 AB - The extracellular segment of the receptor - type type protein tyrosine phosphatase <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , possesses an MAM domain , an immunoglobulin domain , and four fibronectin type - III repeats .
It binds homophilically , i.e. , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  on the surface of one cell binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p2>  on an apposing cell , and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain .
The intracellular segment of <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins .
In cadherins , this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton .
In this article , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  associates with a complex containing <prot>  cadherins , alpha </prot>  - and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  beta - catenin </prot>  </p2>  in mink lung ( MvLu ) cells , and in rat heart , lung , and brain tissues .
Greater than 80 % of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X - 100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  ; however , the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent , SDS - containing RIPA buffer .
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to the intracellular domain of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  </p2>  , but not to alpha - or <prot>  beta - catenin </prot>  .
Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo , <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , cadherins , and catenins all localized to points of cell - cell contact in MvLu cells , as assessed by immunocytochemical staining .
After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells , which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , the cadherins associated with <prot>  PTPm u </prot>  are now found in a tyrosine - phosphorylated form , indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  .
These data suggest that <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation , and thus function , of the cadherin / catenin complex in vivo .
