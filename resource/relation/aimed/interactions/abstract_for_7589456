TI - Interaction of the protein <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  </p2>  , as revealed by the yeast two - hybrid system .
PG - 155 - 8 AB - The heterotrimeric G protein , <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  , transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels .
The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  by use of the yeast two - hybrid system .
A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  .
Four positive colonies were obtained .
Two of the four were identified as <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  , a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti - nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus .
 <prot> Nucleobindin </prot>  has a leucine zipper , EF hands , and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted .
The specificity of intehraction between <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  </p2>  was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins .
Transfection of <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  and <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  in COS cells increased <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  expression relative to cells transfected with <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  and mock vector .
Our results indicate that the yeast two - hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins .
 <prot> Nucleobindin </prot>  appears to represent one of those proteins .
