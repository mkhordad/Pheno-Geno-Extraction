TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  B61 </prot>  </p1>  is a ligand for the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  ECK </prot>  receptor protein - tyrosine kinase </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 558 - 60 AB - A protein ligand for the <prot>  <prot>  ECK </prot>  receptor protein - tyrosine kinase </prot>  has been isolated by using the extracellular domain ( <prot>  ECK </prot>  - X ) of the receptor as an affinity reagent .
Initially , concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized <prot>  ECK </prot>  - X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system .
Subsequently , supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography , resulting in the single - step purification of <prot>  B61 </prot>  , a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by <prot>  tumour necrosis factor - alpha </prot>  .
We report here that recombinant <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  B61 </prot>  </p1>  induces autophosphorylation of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ECK </prot>  </p2>  in intact cells , consistent with <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  B61 </prot>  </p1>  being an authentic ligand for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ECK </prot>  </p2>  .
 <prot> ECK </prot>  is a member of a large orphan receptor protein - tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH , and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to <prot>  B61 </prot>  , and can be isolated in the same way .
