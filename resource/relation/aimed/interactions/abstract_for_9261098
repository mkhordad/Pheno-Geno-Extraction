TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  negatively regulates <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  activity by interactions with the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  cysteine - rich domain .
PG - 20990 - 3 AB - Although <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is a critical effector of <prot>  Ras </prot>  signaling and transformation , the mechanism by which <prot>  Ras </prot>  promotes <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activation is complex and remains poorly understood .
We recently reported that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  interaction with the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  cysteine - rich domain </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  , residues 139 - 184 ) may be required for <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activation .
The <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  is located in the NH2 - terminal negative regulatory domain of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  and is highly homologous to cysteine - rich domains found in protein kinase C family members .
Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  is also critical for <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins .
However , whether 14 - 3 - 3 proteins interact directly with the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  and how this interaction may mediate <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  function has not been determined .
In the present study , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to the isolated <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , mutation of <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  residues 143 - 145 impairs binding of 14 - 3 - 3 , but not <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p2>  , to the <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  .
Introduction of mutations that impair 14 - 3 - 3 binding resulted in full - length <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  mutants with enhanced transforming activity .
Thus , 14 - 3 - 3 interaction with the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  may serve in negative regulation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  function by facilitating dissociation of 14 - 3 - 3 from the NH2 terminus of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .
