TI - <prot>  Interleukin - 10 </prot>  levels in seminal plasma : implications for chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome .
AB - PURPOSE : Chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis .
We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti - inflammatory cytokines within the prostate , namely <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  versus <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  .
We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We measured levels of <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay .
Results were correlated with health related quality of life , as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory , McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score .
RESULTS : The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls .
 <prot> Interferon - gamma </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  levels were statistically greater in patients .
Furthermore , <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  levels correlated directly with measures of life interference ( r = 0.52 , p LTTTTT 0.01 ) and pain severity ( r = 0.53 , p LTTTTT 0 0.01 ) , and inversely with spousal support ( r = - 0.39 , p LTTTTT 0.04 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests that <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome .
