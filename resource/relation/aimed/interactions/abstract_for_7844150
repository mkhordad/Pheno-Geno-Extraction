TI - <prot>  Syntrophin </prot>  binds to an alternatively spliced exon of <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  .
PG - 363 - 71 AB - <prot>  Dystrophin </prot>  , the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus , is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane - associated proteins .
Of these , the 58 - kD intracellular membrane - associated protein , syntrophin , was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes .
We expressed the cDNA of human <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  and the COOH terminus of human <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription / translation system .
Using antibodies to <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions .
We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p1>  , an alternatively spliced exon , are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  in our assay .
On the basis of its alternative splicing , <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations .
In this recombinant expression system , the <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  relatives , human <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  related protein </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  DRP </prot>  </p1>  or <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  utrophin </prot>  </p1>  ) and the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  87K postsynaptic protein </prot>  </p1>  from Torpedo electric organ , also bind to translated <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  .
We have found a COOH - terminal 37 - kD fragment of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  sufficient to interact with translated <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p2>  and its homologues , suggesting that the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p1>  binding site on <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues .
