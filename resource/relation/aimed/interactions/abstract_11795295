TI - Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis .
AB - Comparative analysis of cytokines and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis .
Two types of response were studied : coagulation and fibrinolysis ( incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C ) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer ( shear rate 100 l / s , 60 seconds at 37 degrees C , and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C ) .
Cytokines <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  ( Immunotech , France ) , <prot>  endothelin - 1 </prot>  , and <prot>  soluble cell adhesion molecules </prot>  ( <prot>  sCAM </prot>  ) sP - and <prot>  sE - selectin </prot>  , <prot>  sICAM - 1 </prot>  , and <prot>  sVCAM - 1 </prot>  ( R AMPPPP D , UK ) have been determined using ELISA kits ( photometer , Biomek - 1000 , Beckman , USA ) .
The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph ( Russia ) and smears dyed specifically for DNA .
Correlational changes in morphodensitometric ( MDM ) parameters and cytokine and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  levels in two tests were compared to initial levels .
After rheologic testing , lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed , but chromatin activity had decreased .
Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed .
 <prot> Endothelin - 1 </prot>  and sP - and <prot>  sE - selectin </prot>  levels were not related to function of lymphocytes ( by MDM data ) as seen in both tests ; it is probable that another cell - cell communication mechanism had been switched on .
We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  , which are the active participants in the pro - and anti - inflammatory program in atherogenesis .
Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine - like <prot>  sCAM </prot>  activity in atherosclerosis .
