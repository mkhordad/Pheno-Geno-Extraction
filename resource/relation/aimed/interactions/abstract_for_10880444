TI - <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  antagonists emerge from alterations in the low - affinity binding epitope for receptor <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  .
PG - 3314 - 24 AB - <prot>  Bone morphogenetic protein - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  ) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that , as a member of the <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta </prot>  ( <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  ) superfamily , signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine - kinases in the cell membrane .
The binding epitopes of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BMPR - IA </prot>  </p2>  ( type I ) and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ActR - II </prot>  </p2>  ( type II ) were characterized using <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains .
A large epitope 1 for high - affinity <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  BMPR - IA </prot>  </p1>  binding was detected spanning the interface of the <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer .
A smaller epitope 2 for the low - affinity binding of <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer .
Symmetry - related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  poles .
Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells ; however , only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  activity .
These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP / <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  superfamily .
