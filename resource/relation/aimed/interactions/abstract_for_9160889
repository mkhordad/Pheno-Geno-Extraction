TI - Cross - family interaction between the bHLHZip <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p1>  and bZip <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  proteins results in down - regulation of <prot>  AP1 </prot>  activity .
PG - 2091 - 8 AB - Heterodimerization among the basic - leucine zipper ( bZIP ) proteins or among the basic - helix - loop - helix - leucine zipper ( bHLHZip ) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors .
To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein , <prot>  USF </prot>  , we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with <prot>  USF </prot>  using the yeast two - hybrid system .
A bZip protein , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p1>  , was found to efficiently interact with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p2>  .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> USF </prot>  </p1>  specifically interacts with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  but not with other closely related family members , <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  , <prot>  Fra2 </prot>  , <prot>  FosB </prot>  , or with <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  .
Both the bHLHZip and the N - terminal regions of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p1>  are required for efficient interaction with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p2>  .
In vivo association between <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  has been demonstrated by co - immunoprecipitation .
Expression of exogenous <prot>  USF </prot>  led to a decrease in <prot>  AP1 </prot>  - dependent transcription in F9 cells .
Co - expression of exogenous <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  restored the <prot>  AP1 </prot>  activity in a dose - dependent manner .
These data show that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross - talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families .
