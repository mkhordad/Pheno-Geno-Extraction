TI - Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription / nucleotide excision repair complex <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  , the nucleotide excision repair protein <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  XPG </prot>  </p1>  , and <prot>  Cockayne syndrome group B ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CSB </prot>  </p2>  ) protein </prot>  .
PG - 2157 - 67 AB - The human basal transcription factor <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  plays a central role in two distinct processes .
 <prot> TFIIH </prot>  is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II ( RNAP II ) transcription initiation complex .
Additionally , it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome .
At least two of the subunits of <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  ( <prot>  XPB </prot>  and <prot>  XPD </prot>  proteins ) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) .
We have exploited the availability of the cloned <prot>  XPB </prot>  , <prot>  XPD </prot>  , <prot>  p62 </prot>  , <prot>  p44 </prot>  , and <prot>  p34 </prot>  genes ( all of which encode polypeptide subunits of <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  ) to examine interactions between in vitro - translated polypeptides by co - immunoprecipitation .
Additionally we have examined interactions between <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  components , the human NER protein <prot>  XPG </prot>  , and the <prot>  CSB </prot>  protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome ( CS ) .
Our analyses demonstrate that the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  XPB </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  XPD </prot>  </p2>  , <prot>  p44 </prot>  , and  <prot>  p62 </prot>  proteins interact with each other .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> XPG </prot>  </p1>  protein interacts with multiple subunits of <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  and with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CSB </prot>  </p2>  protein .
