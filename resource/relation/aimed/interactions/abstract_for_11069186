TI - Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain bound to ligand and heparin .
PG - 1029 - 34 AB - Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities .
Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase ( FGFR ) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface .
Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity .
Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF - heparin and FGF - FGFR have been described , the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated .
Here we report the crystal structure of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p1>  ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGF1 </prot>  </p2>  and a heparin decasaccharide .
The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains .
The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain .
The structure of the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGF1 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p2>  - heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling .
