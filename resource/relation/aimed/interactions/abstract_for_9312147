TI - Interactions between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble <prot>  TRKB </prot>  by affinity separation and chemical cross - linking .
PG - 25296 - 303 AB - The extracellular domain of the human <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  neurotrophin <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein , possessing binding ability for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BDNF </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Two distinct ligand binding domains of <prot>  TRKB </prot>  were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized <prot>  BDNF </prot>  .
One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103 - 181 and contains both the third leucine - rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain .
The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin - like domain ( amino acid residues 342 - 394 ) .
Each of these two domains can bind <prot>  BDNF </prot>  independently .
Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for <prot>  BDNF </prot>  binding , probably because of preservation of the native conformation .
To study the second domain in greater detail , a truncated form of <prot>  TRKB </prot>  containing the second immunoglobulin - like domain ( residues 248 - 398 ) was expressed in Escherichia coli .
This domain was cross - linked to <prot>  BDNF </prot>  through a 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide coupling reaction .
Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343 - 379 were able to bind immobilized <prot>  BDNF </prot>  .
Amino acid substitution and cross - linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347 , Asp354 , and Tyr361 are intimately involved in <prot>  BDNF </prot>  binding .
These results , obtained from a variety of experimental techniques , highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  in binding <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  BDNF </prot>  </p2>  .
