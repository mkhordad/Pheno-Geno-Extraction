TI - The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma protein </prot>  </p1>  associates with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  protein phosphatase type 1 </prot>  </p2>  catalytic subunit .
PG - 555 - 69 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma protein </prot>  ( <prot>  p110RB </prot>  ) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth - suppressing function .
We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two - hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind <prot>  p110RB </prot>  .
One clone encodes a novel <prot>  type 1 protein phosphatase </prot>  catalytic subunit ( <prot>  PP - 1 alpha 2 </prot>  ) , which differs from the originally defined <prot>  PP - 1 alpha </prot>  by an amino - terminal 11 - amino - acid insert .
In vitro - binding assays demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PP - 1 alpha </prot>  </p1>  isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p110RB </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , similar <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p110RB </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  sequences are required for binding <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PP - 1 alpha 2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  SV40 large T antigen </prot>  </p2>  .
Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1 .
The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed .
