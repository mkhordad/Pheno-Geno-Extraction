TI - Molecular cloning and expression of the 32 - kDa subunit of human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  reveals interactions with <prot>  VP16 </prot>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  that mediate transcriptional activation .
PG - 5788 - 92 AB - Transcription factor <prot>  TFIID </prot>  consists of <prot>  TATA binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) and at least eight <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factors ( TAFs ) .
As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription , we have proposed that <prot>  TAF </prot>  s act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery .
Here we report the cloning , expression , and biochemical characterization of the 32 - kDa subunit of human ( h ) <prot>  TFIID </prot>  , termed <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  .
We find that <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  is the human homologue of Drosophila <prot>  TAFII40 </prot>  .
In vitro protein - protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila <prot>  TAFII40 </prot>  , <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interacts with the C - terminal 39 - amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  viral protein 16 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  VP16 </prot>  </p2>  ) as well as with the general transcription factor <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , a partial recombinant <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex containing <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the <prot>  VP16 </prot>  activation domain .
These findings indicate that specific activator - coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation .
