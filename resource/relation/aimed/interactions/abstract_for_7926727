TI - Several hydrophobic amino acids in the <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  amino - terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation , binding to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  and the adenovirus <p2  pair=2 >  5 <prot>  E1B </prot>  </p2>  55 - kD protein .
PG - 1235 - 46 AB - The <prot>  p53 </prot>  tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth .
The acidic amino terminus of the <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  protein has been shown to contain this trans - activation activity as well as the domains for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  and adenovirus <p2  pair=4 >  5 <prot>  E1B </prot>  </p2>  55 - kD protein binding .
An extensive genetic analysis of this amino - terminal <prot>  p53 </prot>  domain has been undertaken using site - specific mutagenesis .
The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of <prot>  p53 </prot>  may contribute to , but are not critical for , this trans - activation activity .
Rather , the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu - 22 and Trp - 23 of human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  are both required for trans - activation activity , binding to the adenovirus <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  E1B </prot>  </p2>  55 - kD protein and the human <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  protein in vitro .
In addition , hydrophobic residues Leu - 14 and Phe - 19 are crucial for the interactions between <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and human <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  hdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Hydrophobic residues Trp - 23 and Pro - 27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) <prot>  E1B </prot>  55 - kD protein in vitro .
These mutations have no impact on the ability of the <prot>  p53 </prot>  protein to bind to a <prot>  p53 </prot>  - specific DNA element .
These results suggest that 2 - 4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino - terminal domain of the <prot>  p53 </prot>  protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation .
These very same hydrophobic residues contact the <prot>  hdm - 2 </prot>  and Ad5 <prot>  E1B </prot>  55 - kD oncogene products .
