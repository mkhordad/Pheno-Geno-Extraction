TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IRAK </prot>  </p1>  : a kinase associated with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  interleukin - 1 receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 1128 - 31 AB - The pleiotropic biological activities of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  interleukin - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) are mediated by its type I receptor ( <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL - 1RI </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  ) .
When the ligand binds , <prot>  IL - 1RI </prot>  initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator <prot>  nuclear factor kappa B </prot>  ( <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  ) .
A protein kinase designated <prot>  IRAK </prot>  ( <prot>  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  receptor - associated kinase </prot>  ) was purified , and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned .
When human embryonic kidney cells ( cell line 293 ) over - expressing <prot>  IL - 1RI </prot>  or HeLa cells were exposed to <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  , <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IRAK </prot>  </p1>  rapidly associated with the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 1RI </prot>  </p2>  complex and was phosphorylated .
The primary amino acid sequence of <prot>  IRAK </prot>  shares similarity with that of pelle a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  homolog in Drosophila .
