TI - New structural and functional aspects of the <prot>  type I interferon - receptor </prot>  interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface .
PG - 40425 - 33 AB - Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors , <prot>  ifnar1 </prot>  and <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  , as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti - viral state and an anti - proliferative response .
Here , we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  </p1>  on <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  interferon ( IFN ) alpha2 </prot>  </p2>  by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues .
Of the six AMPPPP quot ; hot - spot AMPPPP quot ; residues identified ( Leu - 30 , Arg - 33 , Arg - 144 , Ala - 145 , Met - 148 , and Arg - 149 ) , four are located on the E - helix , which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A - helix and the AB - loop .
The contribution of residues of the D - helix , which have been previously implicated in binding , proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  .
Interestingly , the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  </p1>  binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IFNalpha2 </prot>  </p2>  .
Thus , hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction , with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex .
Relating the anti - viral and anti - proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated , suggesting that <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  binding is the rate - determining step in cellular activation .
Dose - time analysis of the anti - viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low - level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses .
Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity , these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN - responsive genes over a longer time period , low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential .
