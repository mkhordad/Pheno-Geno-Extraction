TI - Genetic studies on the role of proteinases and growth factors in atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation .
AB - Expression analysis and epidemiologic studies have provided indirect evidence that proteinases and growth factors play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque rupture .
Studies using genetically altered mice have proven to be an elegant tool to study the causal involvement of these factors in atherogenesis and to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms .
Recently , proteinases of the plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) systems as well as their inhibitors have received much attention , and these studies together have emphasized the complexity of their role in vascular disease .
This overview summarizes the current knowledge on <prot>  plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PAI - 1 </prot>  ) in the progression of atherosclerosis and the influence of MMPs in aneurysm formation .
In addition , a possible role for <prot>  Gas6 </prot>  , the product of <prot>  growth arrest - specific gene 6 </prot>  , in atherosclerotic lesion development is put into perspective .
