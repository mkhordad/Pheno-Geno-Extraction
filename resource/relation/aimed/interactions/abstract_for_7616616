TI - A potential interaction of <prot>  p75 </prot>  and <prot>  trkA </prot>  <prot>  NGF </prot>  receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation .
PG - 557 - 63 AB - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Nerve growth factor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds independently to two transmembrane receptors , the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  p75 </prot>  neurotrophin receptor </prot>  </p2>  and the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  p140trk </prot>  ( <prot>  trkA </prot>  ) tyrosine kinase receptor </prot>  </p2>  , which are both co - expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to <prot>  NGF </prot>  .
Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co - expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity <prot>  NGF </prot>  binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness ; however , evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking .
Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I - NGF to detect an association of <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors .
Although multimeric complexes of <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  were not detected by affinity crosslinking , immunoprecipitation of cross - linked <prot>  <prot>  NGF </prot>  - receptor </prot>  complexes with <prot>  trk </prot>  - specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked <prot>  p75 </prot>  .
Our results indicate that the <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  receptors can potentially interact , and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity <prot>  NGF </prot>  binding sites .
