TI - Characterization of an interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  insulin receptor substrate 1 </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  by using the two - hybrid system .
PG - 6433 - 42 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Insulin receptor substrate 1 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  ) is a major substrate of the <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and has been implicated in <prot>  insulin </prot>  signaling .
Although <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  is thought to interact with the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  , the nature of the interaction has not been defined .
In this study , we used the two - hybrid assay of protein - protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
We demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells .
We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity , since <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  shows no interaction with a kinase - inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP - binding site .
Furthermore , mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  interaction in the two - hybrid assay .
These data suggest that the interaction between <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved .
Furthermore , we show that a 356 - amino - acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two - hybrid assay .
Lastly , in agreement with our findings for yeast cells , we show that the <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  is unable to phosphorylate an <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells .
The two - hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction .
