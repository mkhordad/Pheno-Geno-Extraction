TI - Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines .
Analysis of <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  / <prot>  Smad4 </prot>  .
AB - The <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma .
We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction .
These cell lines showed mutations in <prot>  K - ras </prot>  and <prot>  p53 </prot>  at frequencies of 91 % and 95 % , respectively .
Alterations in <prot>  p16INK4a </prot>  were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions , seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases .
Eight cell lines ( 36 % ) had an alteration of <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  , including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions .
The most typical mutational profile involved <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , and <prot>  p16INK4a </prot>  , concurrently aberrated in 20 cases ( 91 % ) .
Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes .
Inactivation of <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes .
This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway .
