TI - Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non - small cell lung cancer .
AB - BACKGROUND : To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members ( <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  , neu / <prot>  ErbB - 2 </prot>  , <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  , and <prot>  ErbB - 4 </prot>  ) and tumor recurrence .
METHODS : We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non - small cell lung cancer .
RESULTS : Using Cox univariate analysis , we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non - well - differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence , and that <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  were also significant predictors .
Co - expression of <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  + , - 3+ , or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence .
A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence .
CONCLUSIONS : The present study shows that in patients with a non - well - differentiated tumor , overexpression of <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence .
The present study also confirmed that <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation .
The correlation between <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  and distant metastasis was good .
