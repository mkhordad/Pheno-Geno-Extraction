TI - Type II regulatory subunit ( RII ) of the cAMP - dependent protein kinase interaction with A - kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5 .
PG - 24245 - 51 AB - Compartmentalization of the <prot>  type II cAMP - dependent protein kinase </prot>  is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit ( RII ) with A - Kinase Anchor Proteins ( AKAPs ) .
In previous studies ( Scott , J. D. , Stofko , R. E. , McDonald , J. R. , Comer , J. D. , Vitalis , E. A. , and Mangili J. ( 1990 ) J. Biol. Chem. 265 , 21561 - 21566 ) we have shown that dimerization of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  microtubule - associated protein 2 </prot>  </p2>  .
In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot> RII des - 5 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( an amino - terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1 - 5 ) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize .
 <prot> RII alpha </prot>  I3A , I5A ( a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine ) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs .
Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization , cAMP binding , or the overall secondary structure of the protein .
Measurement of <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  I3A , I5A interaction with the human <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  thyroid AKAP </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  </p2>  , by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6 - fold .
Therefore , we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs .
