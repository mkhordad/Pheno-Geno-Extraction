TI - Specific binding of the transglutaminase , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  platelet factor XIII </prot>  </p1>  , to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 22379 - 84 AB - <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  , the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein , is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance , growth events , and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics .
In thrombin - stimulated platelets , <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion .
However , the function of <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  and the identity of proteins that interact with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  remain unknown .
To identify specific <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  - protein interactions , a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells .
An 84 - kDa protein was found to associate specifically with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  and was isolated from platelet lysates , resolved on preparative gels , transferred to nitrocellulose , subjected to enzymatic digestion , and microsequenced .
A 20 - amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484 - 503 of the transglutaminase , platelet Factor XIII .
Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p1>  from fresh platelet lysates to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  fusion protein .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> FXIII </prot>  </p1>  also was shown to coprecipitate with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass - activated platelets .
The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  and suggest that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p1>  may participate in the cellular localization and / or enzymatic regulation of platelet <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p2>  .
