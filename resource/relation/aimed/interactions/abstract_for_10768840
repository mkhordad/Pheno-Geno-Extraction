TI - Characterization of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding domain on the human <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  molecule using anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  antibodies .
PG - 43 - 8 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and its counter - receptor <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  ligand </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p2>  ) are members of the TNF - receptor / <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation .
Several monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) have been developed against <prot>  CD30 </prot>  and , based on mutual inhibition assays , are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters .
However , the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for <prot>  CD30L </prot>  is not known .
Using a soluble <prot>  CD30L </prot>  / <prot>  CD8alpha </prot>  chimeric protein , we assessed the ability of anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  MAb to inhibit the binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line .
 <p1  pair=5 >  <prot> CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding by <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A ( like Ber - H2 , Ber - H8 , and HRS - 4 ) as well as cluster Group C ( like HeFi - 1 and M44 ) .
Cluster Group B antibodies , including M67 and Ki - 1 , do not affect <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding to <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  .
The pattern of <prot>  CD30L </prot>  binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  MAb to trigger <prot>  CD30 </prot>  signaling .
Finally , we demonstrate that the anti - <prot>  CD30L </prot>  MAb M81 also completely inhibits <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p2>  interaction .
This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the <prot>  CD30 </prot>  / <prot>  CD30L </prot>  system and for designing assays for soluble <prot>  CD30L </prot>  .
