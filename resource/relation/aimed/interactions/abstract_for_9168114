TI - Ligands for ErbB - family receptors encoded by a neuregulin - like gene .
PG - 509 - 12 AB - Neuregulins ( also called ARIA , GGF , heregulin or NDF ) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene .
Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors ( <prot>  ErbB2 </prot>  , <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  and <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  ) , neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues .
Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin - like gene , <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  .
The encoded product of the <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the <prot>  epidermal growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  EGF </prot>  ) - like domain gives rise to two isoforms ( alpha and beta ) .
Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  is highest in the cerebellum , and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins .
Recombinant <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  neuregulin - 2beta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  induces the tyrosine - phosphorylation of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  ErbB2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  </p2>  in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB - family receptors .
However , in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs , <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  neuregulin - 2beta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  only activates those with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  </p2>  and / or <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  </p2>  , suggesting that signalling by <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  is mediated by <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  and / or <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  receptors .
