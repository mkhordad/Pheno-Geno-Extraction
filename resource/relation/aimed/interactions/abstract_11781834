TI - Role of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells .
AB - Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic .
To characterize these pathways , we focused on changes in the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence .
As a model , we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell ( HPEC ) and human uroepithelial cell ( HUC ) cultures .
After 30 - 40 population doublings cells became growth - arrested in G0 / 1 with a threefold decrease in <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  - associated activity , a point defined as pre - senescence .
Temporally following this growth arrest , the cells develop a senescence morphology and express <prot>  senescence - associated <prot>  beta - galactosidase </prot>  </prot>  ( <prot>  SA - beta - gal </prot>  ) .
Levels of <prot>  p16 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4a </prot>  ) and <prot>  p57 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP2 </prot>  ) rise in HUCs during progressive passages , whereas only <prot>  p16 </prot>  increases in HPEC cultures .
The induced expression of <prot>  p57 </prot>  , similar to <prot>  p16 </prot>  , produces a senescent - like phenotype .
 <prot> pRB </prot>  , <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  , <prot>  p19 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4d </prot>  ) and <prot>  p27 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP1 </prot>  ) decrease in both cell types .
We find that <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p21 </prot>  ( <prot>  CIP1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  p15 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4b </prot>  ) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre - senescent growth arrest , then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence .
Analysis of <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p21 </prot>  ( <prot>  CIP1 </prot>  ) , <prot>  p15 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4b </prot>  ) , <prot>  p16 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4a </prot>  ) , and <prot>  p57 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP2 </prot>  ) reveals altered expression in immortalized , non - tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells .
These results indicate : ( i ) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence , ( ii ) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence , and ( iii ) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization .
