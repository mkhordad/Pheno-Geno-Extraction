TI - Differential expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  and <prot>  perforin </prot>  by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression with^M progression of cancer.^M AB - <prot>  Granulysin </prot>  has been identified as an effector molecule co - localized with <prot>  perforin </prot>  in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer ( NK ) cells , and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of <prot>  perforin </prot>  and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells .
The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  and <prot>  perforin </prot>  by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer .
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of <prot>  perforin </prot>  and <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression by <prot>  CD3 </prot>  ( - ) <prot>  CD16 </prot>  ( + ) cells in healthy controls .
In contrast , cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression ( P LTTTTT 0.005 ) , despite having equally high levels of <prot>  perforin </prot>  expression in comparison with healthy controls .
The tumor - free patients expressed <prot>  granulysin </prot>  at levels similar to healthy controls , while the progressive tumor - bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  compared to healthy controls ( P LTTTTT 0.0001 ) .
Similarly , patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer <prot>  granulysin </prot>  - positive NK cells than healthy controls .
Meanwhile , a considerable number of the tumor - bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells , and a correlation between impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed .
These findings suggest that the tumor - bearing patients with impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression were in an immunosuppressive state .
In conclusion , impaired expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer , and determination of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients .
