TI - Human <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  , a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the <prot>  CDC2 </prot>  gene family .
PG - 1217 - 28 AB - A new human cyclin , named <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  , was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Cyclin E </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  showed genetic interactions with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CDC28 </prot>  </p2>  gene , suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CDC28 </prot>  </p2>  protein .
Two human genes were identified that could interact with <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  to perform START in yeast containing a <prot>  cdc28 </prot>  mutation .
One was <prot>  <prot>  CDC2 </prot>  - HS </prot>  , and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> Cyclin E </prot>  </p1>  produced in E. coli bound and activated the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDC2 </prot>  </p2>  protein in extracts from human G1 cells , and antibodies against <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells .
The interactions between <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDC2 </prot>  </p2>  , or <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  , may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells .
