TI - The POU domains of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p1>  transcription factors mediate specific interaction with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
PG - 1655 - 62 AB - We had previously shown that the ubiquitous <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  and the lymphoid - specific <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation .
We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with <prot>  TBP </prot>  , the <prot>  TATA box binding protein </prot>  component of the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  factor .
By using several different experimental systems we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  efficiently associates with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins .
N - and C - terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction .
We show that the POU homeodomain of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p1>  and the evolutionarily conserved C - terminal core domain of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  are both required and sufficient for the interaction .
The <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p1>  POU domain , which is highly homologous to the <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  POU domain , likewise mediates interaction with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction can also be observed in vivo , as <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  can be co - precipitated with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p2>  from co - transfected Cos1 cells and <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  co - immunoprecipitates with the endogenous <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p2>  from HeLa cells .
Co - transfection of human <prot>  TBP </prot>  and <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter .
