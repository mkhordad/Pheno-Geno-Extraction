TI - Present data concerning the <prot>  renin </prot>  - <prot>  angiotensin </prot>  system of extrarenal origin .
AB - After a brief historical incursion regarding <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin , we present the main extrarenal <prot>  angiotensin </prot>  - forming enzymes , starting with <prot>  isorenin </prot>  , <prot>  tonin </prot>  , D and <prot>  G cathepsin </prot>  and ending with the conversion enzyme and <prot>  chymase </prot>  .
This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue <prot>  RAS </prot>  in the heart and vessels , brain and neurocranial accessory glands , cortico - suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory .
In the end we refer to the relations between circulating <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin and the extrarenal <prot>  RAS </prot>  specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two <prot>  RAS </prot>  components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system , regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria .
While the circulating <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions , tissue <prot>  RAS </prot>  , in paracrine or autocrine ways , exerts local - regional adaptive actions of long duration .
