TI - Efficient interaction of HIV - 1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors .
PG - 2433 - 8 AB - HIV - 1 actively replicates in dendritic cell ( DC ) - T cell cocultures , but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs .
We now find that HIV - 1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells , even though T cells have higher levels of <prot>  CD4 </prot>  and <prot>  gp120 </prot>  binding .
DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly .
Several M - tropic strains and the T - tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently , as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90 - min virus pulse at 37 degrees C .
However , few late gag - containing sequences are detected , so that active viral replication does not occur .
The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV - 1 , rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA .
Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h , or for 90 min at 37 degrees C , conditions which allow virus binding .
Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to <prot>  trypsin </prot>  .
The entry of a M - tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine <prot>  RANTES </prot>  , and the entry of IIIB by SDF - 1 .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> RANTES </prot>  </p1>  interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p2>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  SDF - 1 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CXCR4 </prot>  </p2>  receptors .
Entry of M - tropic but not T - tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  receptor .
DCs express more <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  and <prot>  CXCR4 </prot>  mRNA than T cells .
Therefore , while HIV - 1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs , viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M - and T - tropic virus .
