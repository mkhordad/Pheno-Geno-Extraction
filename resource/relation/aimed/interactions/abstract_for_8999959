TI - Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Id3 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  </p2>  .
Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle - specific gene expression .
PG - 2459 - 63 AB - We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the <prot>  ITF - 2 </prot>  transcription factor , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Id3 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction was confirmed in vitro , and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells .
As expected , overexpression of either <prot>  Id3 </prot>  / <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  or <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle - specific <prot>  creatine kinase </prot>  promoter by the myogenic transcription factor <prot>  MyoD </prot>  .
However , when overexpressed simultaneously , <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  and Id3 / HLH462 counteracted each other 's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition .
Moreover , while <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  inhibited the <prot>  creatine kinase </prot>  promoter , it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site .
Further investigation indicated that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  MyoD </prot>  </p2>  heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro , and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by <prot>  Id3 </prot>  / <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  .
Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating ( <prot>  ITF - 2a </prot>  ) and inhibitory ( <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  ) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures , suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process .
Taken together , this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix - loop - helix proteins than was previously anticipated .
