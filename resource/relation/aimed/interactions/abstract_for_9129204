TI - Early events in TNF signaling : a story of associations and dissociations .
PG - 559 - 66 AB - At the cellular level , the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates , including protein kinases , protein phosphatases , reactive oxygen intermediates , phospholipases , proteases , sphingomyelinases , and transcription factors .
Unlike many cytokine receptors , however , the cytoplasmic domain ( CD ) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins .
Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ , their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins .
A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins .
Two distinct families of proteins have emerged , the TNF receptor - associated factors ( TRAFs ) and the death domain homologues .
The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein - interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  TRADD </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  FADD </prot>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MORT </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , <prot>  RIP </prot>  , <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  FLICE </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  MACH </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , and TRAFs ) associated with both of the <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  p80 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily .
In this review , we summarize these and other TNF receptor - associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of <prot>  nuclear factor - kappaB </prot>  and apoptosis , two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand .
