TI - A histone octamer - like structure within <prot>  TFIID </prot>  .
PG - 356 - 9 AB - The general transcription factor <prot>  TFIID </prot>  nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding , commits promoters within chromatin to transcription , and mediates the action of transcriptional activators , a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced <prot>  TFIID </prot>  recruitment or conformational changes in <prot>  TFIID </prot>  - promoter complexes .
Molecular studies of the multiprotein <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex have identified a primary <prot>  TATA binding subunit </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) , TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation .
Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  subunits <prot>  hTAF80 </prot>  , <prot>  hTAF31 </prot>  and <prot>  hTAF20 / 15 </prot>  .
Together with analyses of native <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies , the results suggest that there is a histone octamer - like TAF complex within <prot>  TFIID </prot>  .
