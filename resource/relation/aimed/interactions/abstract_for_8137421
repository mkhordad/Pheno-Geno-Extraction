TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  </p1>  : a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and <prot>  Ha - Ras </prot>  that binds and phosphorylates the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  activation domain .
PG - 1025 - 37 AB - The ultraviolet ( UV ) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by <prot>  AP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  .
The effect on <prot>  AP - 1 </prot>  transcriptional activity results , in part , from enhanced phosphorylation of the <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  NH2 - terminal activation domain .
Here , we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  , a distant relative of the <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response .
Significantly , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Ha - Ras </prot>  </p1>  partially activates <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  </p2>  and potentiates the activation caused by UV .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> JNK1 </prot>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser - 63 and Ser - 73 .
Thus , <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation .
These properties indicate that <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  activation may play an important role in tumor promotion .
