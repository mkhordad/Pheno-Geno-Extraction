TI - Crystal structure of a complex between <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  and its soluble high - affinity receptor .
PG - 230 - 5 AB - The crystal structure of <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  bound to the extracellular fragment of its high - affinity cell - surface receptor reveals the first view of a class - 2 cytokine receptor - ligand complex .
In the complex , one <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimer binds two receptor molecules .
Unlike the class - 1 growth hormone receptor complex , the two <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  receptors do not interact with one another and are separated by 27 A .
Upon receptor binding , the flexible AB loop of <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  undergoes a conformational change that includes the formation of a 3 ( 10 ) helix .
