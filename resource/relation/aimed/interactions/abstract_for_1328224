Characterization of ligand binding , internalization , and receptor phosphorylation .
PG - 21172 - 8 AB - An expression plasmid encoding the human 75 - kDa <prot>  tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) type 2 receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  ) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line ( 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  ) overexpressing <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  .
Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding ( Kd = 0.2 nM ) with approximately 94 , 000 + / - 7 , 500 sites / cell for 125I - <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and approximately 5 - fold lower affinity for <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  ( Kd = 1.1 nM ) with 264 , 000 + / - 2 , 000 sites / cell .
Cross - linking of 125I - <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and 125I - <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  to 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211 , 000 for <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and 205 , 000 and 244 , 000 for <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  , suggesting these complexes contain two or three <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  molecules .
Immunoprecipitation of <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  from 32P - labeled 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated .
The majority ( 97 % ) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation ( 3 % ) in threonine residues .
 <prot> TNF - alpha </prot>  treatment of 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation .
Cell surface - bound 125I - TNF - alpha was slowly internalized by the 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cell line with a t1 / 2 = 25 min .
Shedding of the extracellular domain of <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  was induced by 4 beta - phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate but not by <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  or <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  .
