PS3605 Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia-3 known also as Rendu - Osler - Weber syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by localized angiodysplasia due to mutations in ENG-26 ( endoglin-28 , 9q34 . 1-32 ) or ALK - 1 gene-38 ( the activin receptor - like kinase 1-46 , 12q13-48 ) .
