M255 for example , it has been reported that the mrna levels of epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factorr are markedly increased in pancreatic cancer tissues in comparison with the normal pancreas , suggesting that the coexpression of epidermal growth factorr and its ligands may contribute to the aggressiveness of human pancreatic cancer .

M347 in fact , the finding of abnormal glucose homeostasis in the knockout mice for fem1b gene , the identification of a germline missense mutation in fem1a gene in a polycystic ovary syndrome patient and the observation of fem1a being downregulated in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines , support this hypothesis [ 8 , 9 , 39 ] .

M422 issues pertaining to muscle - specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis include determining the pathophysiologic role of muscle - specific tyrosine kinase antibodies in the development of myasthenia gravis , whether the immunological attack on the endplate region in muscle - specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis is similar to that of seropositive myasthenia gravis , and whether thymectomy benefits patients with muscle - specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis .

M440 a possible explanation for the lack of definitive morphological markers for basal cell naevus syndrome odontogenic keratocysts may relate to their aetiology : it has been observed that genetic abnormalities ( mutations and loss of heterozygosity ) of common tumour suppressor genes , including the drosophila - homologous patched gene are associated with the basal cell naevus syndrome ( as well as some other epithelial tumours , such as basal cell carcinomas ) .
