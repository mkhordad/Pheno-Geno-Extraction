S186 The targeted epitopes-3 are generated by a post - translational modification-11 catalysed by the calcium - dependent enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase-21 ( PAD-23 ) , which converts positively charged arginine-30 to polar but uncharged citrulline-35 .

S187 The aim of this study was to explore the effects of citrullination-12 on the immunogenicity of autoantigens-17 as well as on potential arthritogenicity .

S189 Our results demonstrate that citrullination of the endogenous antigen-9 RSA-10 broke immunological tolerance-13 , as was evident by the generation of antibodies directed against the modified protein and cross - reacting with the native protein .

S190 In conclusion , our data reveal the potency of citrullination-10 to break tolerance against the self antigen RSA-18 and to increase the arthritogenic properties of the cartilage antigen CII-29 .

S197 We performed linkage and association analyses by transmission / disequilibrium test and case - control analysis in the candidate region-20 12q13 - 24-23 , using the Sardinian founder population , in which limited heterogeneity of pathogenetic alleles-37 for monogenic and complex disorders as well as of environmental conditions should facilitate the study of multifactorial traits-55 .

S200 IRAK - M-3 , a negative regulator of the Toll - like receptor / IL - 1R pathways , is a master regulator of NF - κB-27 and inflammation-29 .

S202 The Ala893 variant-3 has decreased activity compared with the 893Ser variant-11 ; therefore , the association with human IBD is consistent with the murine model of mdr1 deficiency-28 .
